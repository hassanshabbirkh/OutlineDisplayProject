The Church and the pastor sued the Town, arguing that the ordinance violated their rights of free speech by allowing them to keep their signs up for a far shorter time each week than if the sign had been an “Ideological” one.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_M4Capt\" id=\"95569\"><Strong>                iii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Court strikes the statute in opinion by Thomas:                </Strong>', '                All nine Justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the statute                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    violated the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.                </span>                For our present discussion of content-neutrality, what’s most significant is that all nine Justices agreed that the ordinance was                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    content-based,                </span>                even though it did                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    not                </span>                appear to be motivated by a desire to                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    suppress any particular message.                </span>                Therefore, all Justices agreed, it had to be                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    strictly scrutinized                </span>                , and invalidated.

Justice Kagan (joined by Ginsburg and Breyer) agreed with Thomas that the Court does, and should continue to, apply strict scrutiny to facially content-based regulations of speech “when there is any                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    ‘realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.’ ”                </span>                And she agreed that, because there is such a possibility of suppression when the regulation on its face differentiates “on the                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    basis of viewpoint,”                </span>                or restricts “discussion of an                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    entire topic”                </span>                in public debate, strict scrutiny is needed in                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">                    those                </span>                instances.

But Kagan gave several examples of categories of signs that, under the majority’s standard, could not be given any preference without being struck down, but that she thought might be constitutionally permissible. For instance, according to the majority’s analysis a town could not give preference for signs informing passersby                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    “where George Washington slept,”                </span>                unless the town could show a compelling interest in doing so.

Broadrick, who had campaigned for a superior and had solicited money for him, challenged §818 on overbreadth (as well as vagueness) grounds. He pointed out that §818 had been construed as applying to such political expression as the wearing of political buttons and the displaying of bumper stickers, which (he asserted) were constitutionally-protected free speech activities.

The ordinance was enacted in response to two fears: (1) that during the busy rush hour, people were handing out so many handbills that the flow of pedestrian traffic was frequently impaired; and (2) that an extraordinary amount of litter was being generated when people who had handbills thrust into their hands dropped them on the sidewalk. Kermit, a political candidate who was giving out brochures in support of his own candidacy, was charged with violating the statute.

One day he went to a park that was frequented by people on both sides of the immigration issue. Before a moderately interested audience of about 20 people, all of whom had come to the park for other purposes, Leonard began to make a speech. He said, “If the federal government doesn’t start doing a whole lot more to keep out illegal immigrants, we’ll have to make ’em do it. Let’s start by building up an arsenal of automatics and machine guns. Eventually, we’ll have guerilla cells throughout the Southwest to make the federal government’s life such a hell they’ll build the kind of huge border fence we need.” A few of the listeners applauded, one asked a question, but no one took any other action in apparent response to Leonard’s speech. Immediately after his speech, Leonard was arrested by the police for violating §123 of a state statute. That statute provided that it is a felony to “advocate insurrection against the state or federal government or any local subdivision thereof.” Leonard now defends on the grounds that a conviction would violate his First Amendment rights.

Furthermore, although his statement about having guerilla cells could probably be interpreted as a call for illegality, his statement about “building up an arsenal” is not necessarily a call for illegality, since there are many legal ways to buy guns, even automatics and machine guns.

Because of the ordinance’s lack of specificity, undue discretion is given to local law enforcement officials, who depending on how they felt about Becky or toplessness generally could decide to look the other way rather than making an arrest.

Suppose further that Facebook learns that P is such an offender, and cancels his user ID under the terms of service. Can P argue that First Amendment principles (or perhaps common-law “public policy” principles inspired by the First Amendment) prevent Facebook from imposing this restriction on him given that government wouldn’t be allowed to do so?                    </span></Strong>', '                It seems clear that P will                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    lose                </span>                with this argument.

And it’s unlikely that the courts will recognize any sort of federal or state “common-law right to free expression” “inspired” by First Amendment concerns.                <a id=\"Ch14__FNB_8\" name=\"Ch14__FNB_8\"></a><a href=\"#Ch14__FNH_8\"><sup>                        8                    </sup></a><span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-size : 11.50pt;\"><a id=\"index_124444\" name=\"index_124444\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Internet\" id=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Internet\" name=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Internet\"></a><a id=\"index_124466\" name=\"index_124466\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Public%20forum:Internet%20as\" id=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Internet_as\" name=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Internet_as\"></a><br/></span></p>', '<p class=\"_L8Capt\" id=\"26589\"><Strong>                d.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Rules:                </Strong>', '                Once a place becomes a designated public forum, the                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    same rules apply as apply to true public forums:                </span>                (1) content-based regulation will be strictly scrutinized; and (2) content-neutral “time, place and manner” regulation must be narrowly drawn to serve significant governmental interests, while leaving open adequate alternative channels for the communication.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_M4Capt\" id=\"26701\"><Strong>                i.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Government may change its mind:                </Strong>', '                The only difference between a true public forum and a designated public forum is that with a designated forum, government may at any time                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    change its mind                </span>                , and                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    remove the designation                </span>                — at that point the forum becomes a non-public forum (see immediately below), which may be subjected to much greater “time, place and manner” regulation.                <a id=\"index_29626\" name=\"index_29626\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Public%20forum:Designated%20public%20forum\" id=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Designated_public_forum\" name=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Designated_public_forum\"></a><br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L6Capt\" id=\"26709\"><Strong>                6.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0                <a id=\"XREF_18626_123\" name=\"XREF_18626_123\"></a><a id=\"XREF_Non-public_forum123\" name=\"XREF_Non-public_forum123\">                    Non-public forums                </a><span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span><ruby><a id=\"index_26708\" name=\"index_26708\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Public%20forum:Non-public%20forums\" id=\"%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Non-public_forums\" name=\"%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Non-public_forums\"></a></ruby></Strong>', '                A final category consists of those public facilities which are used for purposes                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    not particularly linked to expression                </span>                .

The all-comers policy requires any RSO to accept all students who apply, and also forbids RSOs from discriminating on the basis of various specified criteria, one of which is sexual orientation. P (the Christian Legal Society) refuses to accept any student who engages in “unrepentant homosexual conduct,” or who holds religious convictions different from those contained in a “Statement of Faith” the Society has adopted. Hastings refuses to grant P the RSO status because of these limits on who may join. P claims that the all-comers policy violates the First Amendment requirement that when government restricts access to limited public forums (i.e., non-public forums) the restriction must be both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.\\n                    <br/>\\n</span>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_M2\" id=\"40831\" style=\"margin-left : 108.00pt;text-indent : 14.40pt;\">\\n<span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    Held\\n                </span>\\n                , for Hastings: the all-comers policy is constitutional.

While the flag burned, the protestors chanted, “America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.” Johnson was charged with violating the desecration statute; at his trial, several witnesses testified that they had been seriously offended by the flag burning, and he was convicted.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L8Capt\" id=\"10226\"><Strong>                c.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Holding:                <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></Strong>', '                By a 5-4 vote, the Court held that the Texas statute violated the First Amendment as applied to Johnson’s acts.

That is, the majority determined that the prosecution of Johnson was                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    “directly related to expression.”                </span>                In reaching this conclusion, the Court reviewed the two objectives that Texas asserted it was pursuing: (1) preventing breaches of the peace; and (2) preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. As to objective (1), the majority simply disbelieved that preventing breaches of the peace was what had motivated Texas on these facts (since no disturbance of the peace either actually occurred or was threatened by this particular flag burning). As to objective (2), the need to protect the flag as a symbol of national unity would only be implicated if the defendant’s conduct had a contrary message associated with it, so this objective was “directly related to expression” and thus called for track one scrutiny. The content-based nature of the statute was illustrated by the fact that particular conduct was covered only if an observer’s likely reaction would be to be “seriously offended” — the offense could only flow from the message accompanying the act. (For instance, if D had burned the flag as a means of respectfully disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he would not have offended anyone, and he would not have been convicted under the statute.)                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_M4Capt\" id=\"10230\"><Strong>                ii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Strict scrutiny applied:                <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></Strong>', '                Since Johnson was prosecuted only because of the content of the particular message he was conveying, the Court applied strict scrutiny to the statute. “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Here, Texas’s objective — preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity — may have been worthy, even “compelling.” But the means chosen by Texas to serve that objective were not necessary ones. First, the majority didn’t believe that the nation’s belief in the cherished significance of the flag would be undermined by acts of mutilation; indeed, these acts might produce the opposite result. Second, the government could combat such acts by acts of its own, such as giving the remains of the flag a respectful burial (as one witness to Johnson’s burning did).                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L8Capt\" id=\"10232\"><Strong>                d.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dissent:                <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></Strong>', '                Four members of the Court bitterly dissented. The principal dissent was by Justice Rehnquist (joined by White and O’Connor). The dissenters thought that a state could prohibit the burning of a flag without violating the First Amendment prohibition on suppression of ideas. “The flag is not simply another ‘idea’ or ‘point of view’ competing for recognition in the market place of ideas.” Also, the dissenters thought that flag burning is so inherently inflammatory that it inevitably threatens a breach of the peace, and thus could be analogized to “fighting words” and deprived of First Amendment protection entirely. In a separate dissent, Justice Stevens thought that the flag, even though it is in a sense an intangible asset, could be protected from desecration just as, say, the Lincoln Memorial could be protected from having a political message spray-painted upon it.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L6Capt\" id=\"10234\"><Strong>                2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0                <a id=\"index_13909\" name=\"index_13909\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Flag%20desecration%20and%20misuse:Federal%20statute\" id=\"FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Federal_statute\" name=\"FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Federal_statute\"></a><a id=\"XREF_24478_123\" name=\"XREF_24478_123\">                    The federal statute:                </a><span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></Strong>', '                The problem with the Texas statute in                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">                    Texas v. Johnson                </span>                seemed to be the statute’s proscription of flag burning that would “seriously offend” observers — this reference to “offensiveness” made it clear that only flag burning intended to convey a particular message (disrespect) was proscribed by the statute. Therefore, immediately after the                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">                    Johnson                </span>                decision, the U.S. Congress tried to enact a                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    federal                </span>                flag burning statute that would ban all or most flag burning without being content-based and thus unconstitutional. This federal statute, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, punished anyone who “knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States. … ” However, even though the statute avoided any reference to conduct that would “offend” an observer, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, found that this statute, too, was a violation of the First Amendment.                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    U.S. v.

Since Congress was attempting to “suppress … expression out of concern for its likely communicative impact,” the statute had to be strictly scrutinized. It failed that scrutiny.

The mayor, without knowing the precise purpose of the demonstration and knowing only that it was to be a demonstration against the local government, refused to issue the permit. In announcing the refusal, the mayor stated that “there has been too much demonstration, and not enough cooperation, around here recently.” Firebrand then brought suit for an injunction against continued application of the permit requirement, and for a declaratory judgment that the permit requirement as drafted was unconstitutional.

Under the terms of the ordinance, the police commissioner was required to issue the permit, subject only to the rule that if in the commissioner’s reasonable judgment, a breach of peace would be likely to occur which could not be controlled with the manpower available to the Lawton Police Department, the permit could be denied until such later date as proper police protection could be arranged (by borrowing from other police departments, if necessary).\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"15523\">\\n                Rouser, a radical, applied late on Friday afternoon to make a speech on Saturday.

A local Justice of the Peace Court was open Friday night, and the Justice would have had jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the permit requirement. However, Rouser did not seek an injunction. Instead, Rouser gave his speech anyway, and no violence occurred. Rouser was charged with violating the permit requirement. He is now defending on the grounds that he was wrongfully denied the permit, because there was not in fact a serious threat of a breach of the peace, and that even if there was one, the presence of three officers would have been sufficient.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"15524\">\\n                Assuming that the court agrees with Rouser’s factual contentions about the danger of breach of the peace, should Rouser be acquitted?  _________________\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q1\" id=\"15527\">\\n                81.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q2\" id=\"15528\">\\n                The city of Blue Bell has enacted an ordinance providing as follows: no “canvasser or solicitor” may ring the doorbell of a private home, or knock on the door of a private home, where her purpose is to distribute handbills or to solicit an order for goods, services or charitable contributions. The ban does not prevent a person from simply sticking advertising material under the door or into the mail slot, so long as there is no bell-ringing or door-knocking.

Mohammed then made various anti-Semetic inflammatory statements, such as “Jews are corrupt” and “Jews control the U.S. government.” He also addressed the Jews in the audience, saying, “You Jews in the audience today, you’re not fit to kiss the dung-stained shoes of my poorest follower.” At no time did Mohammed urge his audience to attack any of the Jewish onlookers or to otherwise commit immediate illegal acts.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"15534\">\\n                Some of the Jews in the audience began to shake their fists and yell back at Mohammed; five of them then began to move towards the podium with upraised fists.

Finally, the requirement that alternative channels be left open is strictly construed in a public-forum context; the fact that there may be other public places (e.g., smaller streets) where the same expression is allowed will not generally be enough to qualify as an adequate alternative channel.\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;\">\\n<a id=\"index_153815\" name=\"index_153815\">\\n</a>\\n<a data-indexterm=\"%3C$endrange%3ENARROW%20TAILORING:Time,%20place%20and%20manner%20regulations%20as%20requiring\" id=\"%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring\" name=\"%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring\">\\n</a>\\n</span>\\n<br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R1\" id=\"15875\">\\n                78.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R2\" id=\"15876\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    Yes.\\n                </span>\\n                An advance permit requirement will be upheld if it is content-neutral, adequately constrains administrative discretion, and is a reasonable means of insuring that public order is maintained.

Here, the standard given for granting or denying a permit — that the proposed activities “not be detrimental to the overall community” — gives the mayor virtually uncontrolled discretion, and acts as an invitation to him to behave in a content-based way. This excessive discretion makes the statute overbroad and vague. Therefore, even though Firebrand’s own proposed conduct might be capable of being prohibited by an appropriately-drawn ordinance, the ordinance here must be struck down as invalid on its face.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R1\" id=\"15879\">\\n                79.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R2\" id=\"15880\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    Yes.\\n                </span>\\n                If a permit that is required prior to the exercise of First Amendment rights is unconstitutional\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n</span>\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    on its face\\n                </span>\\n                , the speaker is\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    not required\\n                </span>\\n                to apply for a permit. He may decline to apply, then speak, and avoid conviction on the grounds of the permit requirement’s unconstitutionality.

Because a statute that is overbroad is facially invalid, this rule applies to overbreadth claims. Therefore, Firebrand may assert overbreadth even though he failed to ever apply for a permit.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R1\" id=\"15889\">\\n                80.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R2\" id=\"15890\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    No.\\n                </span>\\n                Where a permit requirement is not facially invalid (e.g., not unduly vague or overbroad), and the speaker’s claim is merely that he has been wrongfully denied a permit, the speaker\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n</span>\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    must seek judicial relief\\n                </span>\\n                before speaking. That is, for an “as applied” as opposed to “facial” challenge to a permit requirement, one who ignores the denial of the permit loses the right to object to the permit scheme’s unconstitutionality. There is an exception where the applicant shows that he could not have obtained prompt judicial review of the administrative denial of the permit; however, the facts here tell us that Rouser could have obtained judicial review prior to the time for the speech, if he had wanted to do so.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R1\" id=\"15894\">\\n                81.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R2\" id=\"15895\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    No.\\n                </span>\\n                As with any “time, place and manner” restriction, the ordinance will be valid only if it is content-neutral, is\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;\">\\n<a id=\"index_153830\" name=\"index_153830\">\\n</a>\\n<a data-indexterm=\"NARROW%20TAILORING:Time,%20place%20and%20manner%20regulations%20as%20requiring\" id=\"NARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring\" name=\"NARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring\">\\n</a>\\n</span>\\n                narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leaves open alternative channels for communicating the information. Here, probably the requirement of content-neutrality is satisfied (unless there is evidence that, say, Jehovah’s Witnesses were a special target of the ordinance). The government probably has a significant government interest in preventing homeowners from being disturbed at home when they do not want to be. However, it is doubtful that the ordinance is “narrowly tailored,” since there are less restrictive alternatives (e.g., permitting a homeowner to indicate on his door that he does not wish to be disturbed by solicitors) — when the city makes a blanket assumption that\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    no\\n                </span>\\n                homeowner wishes to receive a solicitor, this is probably not a sufficiently narrowly tailored approach. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether alternative channels have been left open, since for many types of organizations, door-to-door and face-to-face is the only affordable means, given the large expense associated with, say, newspaper and TV advertising. Upon facts similar to these, the Court struck down a blanket ban. See\\n                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    Watchtower Bible and Tract Soc. v.

That is, it proscribes only certain types of speech, based on the content or message of that speech. Thus insults based on race, ethnicity and three other attributes are banned, but insults based on other attributes are not (e.g., the addressee’s politics, intelligence, short or tall stature, etc.).

The best way for State U to solve the problem is to amend its code so as to ban “all slurs, invectives, insults or epithets that would have the likely effect of either inducing the listener to respond with violence, or which would be likely to create in the listener an apprehension of imminent physical harm.” Such a formulation would essentially ban all fighting words, plus all words that would constitute an assault; these two categories may clearly be constitutionally proscribed, as long as the proscription occurs in a content-neutral way.

The statute gave an exemption for a depiction that has “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical or artistic value.” The legislative history of the statute showed that it was designed to eliminate the market for                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    “crush videos,”                </span>                videos depicting the intentional torture and killing of small animals, often by showing women slowly crushing the animals to death with their bare feet or high-heeled shoes.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L8Capt\" id=\"41501\"><Strong>                a.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The defendant:                </Strong>', '                But in                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">                    Stevens                </span>                , D was convicted not for selling a crush video, but for selling videos of                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    dogfights                </span>                involving pitbulls.

For instance, the statute covered depictions in which a living animal was “wounded or killed,” even if no cruelty was involved. It was true that the statute applied only where the conduct depicted was against the law of the state where the video was made, possessed, or sold. But the statute by its terms would apply to, say, the depiction of hunting done by a particular method that was legal in the place where it happened, but illegal in the place where the resulting video was possessed or sold.

In fact, Tim was shot in Joe’s store, but by Pete, Joe’s employee, who Joe then immediately fired. (Tim was not in fact trying to shoplift, and Pete simply made a bad mistake.)

Together with a prior ban on broadcast advertising for cigarettes, this means that billboards and handbills are now the only allowable means of advertising cigarettes.

So if Joe is a public figure, then the judge’s instruction is wrong. Joe might be held to be an “involuntary public figure” because of his involvement in this matter of obvious public interest; however, since he is not a criminal defendant, and since the Court has construed the “involuntary public figure” category narrowly, probably Joe does not fall into this category. Joe is certainly not a generally famous person (even locally), nor one who has voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy, so he probably doesn’t fit into either of the other public figure categories recognized by the Court.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R3\" id=\"16009\" style=\"text-indent : 10.80pt;\">\\n                If Joe is in fact a “private figure,” then the judge’s charge is correct.

(On the other hand, the state would not be permitted to grant Joe a recovery based on strict liability; the First Amendment requires that the\\n                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    Post\\n                </span>\\n                be proven to be at least negligent, even in a suit brought by a private figure.)\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R1\" id=\"16015\">\\n                88.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_R2\" id=\"16016\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    (a)\\n                </span>\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    Yes.\\n                </span>\\n                On these facts, Kiddie World is probably not, strictly speaking, “obscene” under Supreme Court definitions. The reason is that mere nudity, without any attempt to portray sexual activity, is not considered “obscene.” However, the state’s interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children is so strong that states may prohibit the sale, and even the private possession, of sexually explicit nude pictures of children, even though these are not strictly speaking “obscene.”\\n                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    Osborne v.

General cigarette advertising is not “misleading” and does not propose unlawful activity (since Congress has not outlawed the sale of cigarettes), so the speech gets some First Amendment protection. It’s true that the government’s interest in preventing additional people (especially minors) from becoming “addicted” certainly seems to be “substantial.” It’s also true that a ban on all print advertising certainly seems to “directly advance” the objective of preventing the creation of new smokers, given the power of advertising.

The plurality did, however, articulate what it saw as the appropriate constitutional standard: a school board has wide authority in determining what books to remove from a library, but it may not remove books for the purpose of                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    denying access to ideas for political or partisan reasons                </span>                . As an extreme example, the plurality noted that a Democratic school board could not, motivated by party affiliation, order the removal of all books written by Republicans.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L8Capt\" id=\"10956\"><Strong>                b.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Curriculum and textbooks:                <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></Strong>', '                It is hard to know what standard the Court will apply to the issue of school authorities’ discretion to select the                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    curriculum                </span>                and                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    required textbooks                </span>                .

For instance, it is doubtful that a majority of the Court would uphold a school board’s rule that no teacher may express in class the opinion that the war in Vietnam was morally and legally wrong.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_M4Capt\" id=\"10958\"><Strong>                i.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Teacher’s own expression of views:                <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></Strong>', '                At the same time,                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    individual teachers                </span>                may probably take actions which a school board would not be permitted to take on a system-wide basis. For instance, a teacher may certainly constitutionally express to his students a view about the morality or legality of the Vietnam War, whether or not the school system may formulate an “official” view on the same subject; this distinction is appropriate because an individual teacher’s views do not represent an “official” or “orthodox” position in the same way that a system-wide positi                <a id=\"index_153437\" name=\"index_153437\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Schools:Teaching%20materials,%20choice%20of\" id=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Teaching_materials,_choice_of\" name=\"%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Teaching_materials,_choice_of\"></a>                on does.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_L6Capt\" id=\"38698\"><Strong>                4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0                <a id=\"index_153438\" name=\"index_153438\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Schools:Students,%20speech%20by\" id=\"FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Students,_speech_by\" name=\"FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Students,_speech_by\"></a>                Speec                <a id=\"index_153439\" name=\"index_153439\"></a><a data-indexterm=\"FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Students,%20speech%20by\" id=\"FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Students,_speech_by\" name=\"FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Students,_speech_by\"></a>                h by students:                </Strong>', '                What about                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    speech by students?                </span>                Students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-style:Italic;\"></span><span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">                    Tinker v.

The principal demanded that Frederick take down the banner, because she thought it encouraged illegal drug use in violation of school policy; she also suspended him from school.                <br/></p>', '<p class=\"_M4Capt\" id=\"38725\"><Strong>                ii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Action upheld:                </Strong>', '                The Court held that the confiscation of the banner and suspension of Frederick                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">                    did not violate                </span>                his First Amendment rights.

Any justification had to take into account the context in which the statement was made, including “time, place and manner.” Here, P had no policy-making or law-enforcement responsibilities and her statement had no discernible impact on the functioning of the Constable’s office, so the State failed to justify the dismissal.                <span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">                    Rankin v.

Any program using these grants is known as a “Title X project.” The Secretary of Health and Human Services then makes a new interpretation of the grant program, under which every Title X project is prohibited from “counselling [patients] concerning the use of abortion” or from “encourag[ing] or promot[ing] abortion.” Grantees who have been receiving funds argue that this new condition violates their and their patients’ freedom of speech, by stripping the grantees of the right to counsel a patient that she has a constitutionally-protected right to have an abortion in certain circumstances.\\n                    <br/>\\n</span>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_M2\" id=\"70509\">\\n<span style=\"font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    Held\\n                </span>\\n                , the new interpretation is not an unconstitutional condition, and does not violate the First Amendment. “[T]he Government is not denying a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that\\n                <span style=\"font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;\">\\n                    public funds be spent\\n                </span>\\n                for the purposes for which they were authorized.” A critical distinction is between the “project” (the particular activity paid for by the grant funds, namely operating a family-planning clinic), and the “grantee” (the individuals or group that are running the project).

There is evidence that the PFPR was able to plant the bombs so successfully inside the buildings because its members or sympathizers have jobs in government agencies located in those buildings, who could furnish information and access for placement of the bombs. To deal with the threat, the territorial government of Puerto Rico has now imposed a requirement that any new applicant for any government position must before being hired sign a loyalty oath stating, among other things, that “I am not a member of the People for a Free Puerto Rico or of any group advocating the use of force to alter the territorial status of Puerto Rico.” Ramona, an applicant for a position as a clerical worker in the Puerto Rican government, has declined to sign the oath, without specifying her reasons.

Horace protested his innocence, and the District Attorney eventually decided that no charges should be brought. Shortly thereafter, Sheryl said to a co-worker, while on the job, “I still think Horace took the money, and I think he’s a crook.” Another employee who overheard the remark reported it to Horace, who immediately fired Sheryl for insubordination and fomenting discord in the Department.

Years ago, the A.G. promulgated a rule (“Rule 100”) requiring any charity that solicits more than $10,000 in total donations in any year from West Carolina residents to report to the A.G. the names and addresses of any donor (whether residing in West Carolina or not) who has contributed more than $5,000 in that year.  Rule 100 includes a promise by the A.G.’s office that it will keep any reported information secret from the public. (However, several years ago, due to a clerical error in the office, the Rule 100 donor reports from several charities were made publicly available on the office’s website.) The administrative history of Rule 100 shows that it was enacted so that if the A.G.’s office ever had reason to suspect that a given charity was committing fraud in soliciting, that charity’s up-to-date donor information would already be present in the A.G.’s files, eliminating any need for the office to subpoena records from the charity at the start of an investigation.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"149740\">\\n                Toys for Kids, a Nevada-based charity that raises about $100,000 per year from West Carolina residents, has sued the A.G.’s office in federal court, claiming that Rule 100 violates Toys’ (and its donors’) First Amendment freedom of association. The charity argues that given the risk that the identities of its donors might be leaked by mistake (as happened previously), Rule 100 cannot survive the relevant standard of review — whatever that standard is — because any interest the A.G.’s office may have in combating fraudulent solicitations can be adequately served by the less-intrusive alternative of issuing document subpoenas to a particular charity when and if the office has reason to suspect the charity of fraud.\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"149741\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    (a)\\n                </span>\\n                What standard should the court use in determining whether Rule 100, as applied to Toys, violates Toys’ and its donors First Amendment freedom of association? _________________\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"149742\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    (b)\\n                </span>\\n                Using the standard you supplied in part (a), should the court find that Rule 100 is unconstitutional as applied to Toys? _________________\\n                <br/>\\n</p>', '<p class=\"_Q3\" id=\"149743\">\\n<span style=\"font-weight:Bold;\">\\n                    (c)\\n                </span>\\n                For this part only, assume (whether the assumption is correct or not) that the court finds that Rule 100 unconstitutionally violates Toys’ freedom of association.

The press learned of the confession through pretrial proceedings in open court, and did not act improperly in obtaining this information. Prosecutors decided to try Summers as a principal in the murder, and also decided to charge B.C. Scowling, a long-time friend of Summers, as an accomplice.

In the most celebrated crime to hit Hillsdale in many years, Joshua, an eight-year-old boy, was found strangled in front of his house. The police have not found any suspects. One week after the killing, Roger published an article saying, “A source that I cannot identify saw the crime from a distance, and believes that the perpetrator was a young white male about 22 years old, six feet tall, weighing about 175 pounds.” In the ensuing months, the police have never been able to find this or any other witness to the crime. The prosecutor called Roger in front of a grand jury, and demanded that he identify the witness who served as his source. Roger stated under oath that the witness was fearful that the killer would kill her to silence her. Roger further stated that he had signed a written pledge to the witness that he would never reveal her name; only in response to this pledge did the witness agree to speak to him. Roger did say, however, that the witness lived in the neighborhood and that in his opinion, she could be identified by good police work. The judge then ordered Roger to disclose the witness’ identity, or be found in contempt of court. Roger refused. There is no state law relevant to the issue.

Since the Court has not so far struck down the federal limits, the $5,000 limit presumably remains a valid means of achieving the compelling governmental interest in combating corruption and its appearance.
