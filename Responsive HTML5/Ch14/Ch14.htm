All of the examples we&#x2019;ve considered so far of content&#x2D;based restrictions are ones in which it&#x2019;s clear that the government was singling out speech <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">based on the particular viewpoint or message it contained. </span>But there&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:Italic;">another</span> type of content&#x2D;based regulation, one that does not single out particular viewpoints.

Apparently this category included <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">political speech</span> that was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> related to any current <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">election campaign.</span> Ideological Signs were treated<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> </span>quite<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> favorably</span>, in that they could be up to 2&#x30; square feet in area, could be placed in all zoning districts, and were not subject to limits on how long they could remain posted.<br/></p><p class="BulletParInd" id="95565" style="margin-left : 108.00pt;text-indent : -18.00pt;"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">[2]</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;Temporary Directional Signs,&#x201d;</span> which included, most relevantly, signs giving the particulars of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">events to be held by non&#x2D;profit groups</span>, such as the time and place for church services. These signs were treated much less favorably than Ideological Signs &#x2014; they could be no larger than 6 square feet; could number no more than four on a single property at once; and had to be put up no more than 12 hours before the event and taken down within an hour afterwards. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="95567"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; The conflict&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="95568"></a>The plaintiffs were the Good News Community Church and its pastor. Because the Church was cash&#x2D;strapped, it wanted to publicize its services cheaply; posting signs around town was the main way it chose. The Church and the pastor sued the Town, arguing that the ordinance violated their rights of free speech by allowing them to keep their signs up for a far shorter time each week than if the sign had been an &#x201c;Ideological&#x201d; one.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="95569"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Court strikes the statute in opinion by Thomas&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="95570"></a> All nine Justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the statute <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">violated the plaintiffs&#x2019; First Amendment rights. </span>For our present discussion of content&#x2D;neutrality, what&#x2019;s most significant is that all nine Justices agreed that the ordinance was<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> content&#x2D;based,</span> even though it did <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> appear to be motivated by a desire to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">suppress any particular message. </span>Therefore, all Justices agreed, it had to be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strictly scrutinized</span>, and invalidated. We&#x2019;ll focus on Justice Thomas&#x2019; opinion, in which he announced the result and gave a rationale that five other Justices supported.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="95581"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Strict scrutiny is triggered&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="95582"></a>The ordinance was clearly content&#x2D;based, due to its <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">on&#x2D;its&#x2D;face classification based on subject matter and purpose.</span> Therefore, Thomas said, the Court was required to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">subject it to strict scrutiny.</span> Thus the Town bore the burden of demonstrating that the Code&#x2019;s differentiation between Temporary Directional Signs and other types of signs, such as Ideological Signs, &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">furthers a compelling interest and is <a id="index_153696" name="index_153696"></a><a data-indexterm="NARROW%20TAILORING:Content-based%20classifications%20as%20requiring" id="NARROW_TAILORING_Content-based_classifications_as_requiring" name="NARROW_TAILORING_Content-based_classifications_as_requiring"></a></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">narrowly tailored to that end.&#x201d;<br/></span></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="95583"></a><span class="BoldBody">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Easy to strike down&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="95584"></a> In Thomas&#x2019; view (which on this point was shared by all Justices), the Town had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> come even remotely close to satisfying this very difficult burden. The Town had cited only two governmental interests in support of the distinction&#x3A; preserving the town&#x2019;s <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">aesthetic appeal</span>, and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">maintaining traffic safety</span>. Even if these were compelling interests (which Thomas assumed but did not decide), the distinctions used in the code were &#x201c;hopelessly <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">underinclusive.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="99677" style="margin-top : 3.00pt;"></a>For instance, the Town &#x201c;cannot claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">necessary to beautify </span>the Town while at the same time<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> allowing unlimited numbers of other types of signs that create the same problem.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="95585"></a>iv.&#160;&#160;&#160; Concurrence only in result&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="95586"></a> But three members of the Court disagreed with parts of Thomas&#x2019; reasoning, and therefore concurred only in the result. Justice Kagan (joined by Ginsburg and Breyer) agreed with Thomas that the Court does, and should continue to, apply strict scrutiny to facially content&#x2D;based regulations of speech &#x201c;when there is any <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">‘realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.&#x2019; &#x201d;</span> And she agreed that, because there is such a possibility of suppression when the regulation on its face differentiates &#x201c;on the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">basis of viewpoint,&#x201d;</span> or restricts &#x201c;discussion of an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">entire topic&#x201d;</span> in public debate, strict scrutiny is needed in <span style="font-style:Italic;">those</span> instances. But, she said, in cases where hidden official suppression of ideas <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">is &#x201c;not realistically possible,&#x201d; </span>the Court should perhaps <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;relax our guard</span> so that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">‘entirely reasonable&#x2019; laws</span> imperiled by strict scrutiny can <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">survive</span>.&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="95587"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Examples&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="95588"></a>Kagan agreed that the present statute was not one of those cases where hidden official suppression was &#x201c;not realistically possible&#x201d;; that&#x2019;s why she concurred in the result. But Kagan gave several examples of categories of signs that, under the majority&#x2019;s standard, could not be given any preference without being struck down, but that she thought might be constitutionally permissible. For instance, according to the majority&#x2019;s analysis a town could not give preference for signs informing passersby<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> &#x201c;where George Washington slept,&#x201d;</span> unless the town could show a compelling interest in doing so. Kagan predicted that courts across the U.S. would now have to invalidate the &#x201c;entirely reasonable&#x201d; sign restrictions of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">thousands of towns. </span>&#x201d;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"><br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="95657"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_18274__d__Rule_on_distinctions_between_various_subjects_or_t123" name="XREF_18274__d__Rule_on_distinctions_between_various_subjects_or_t123">Rule on distinctions between various &#x201c;topics&#x201d; or &#x201c;subjects&#x201d;&#x3A; <br/></a></p><p class="_L8Text" id="95658"></a> So to summarize, cases like <span style="font-style:Italic;">Reed v. Gilbert</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, mean that the requirement of content&#x2D;neutrality effectively bars the government not only from (1) showing favoritism as between differing <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">points of view </span>(or &#x201c;messages&#x201d;) on a particular subject, but also from (2) placing a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">particular topic or subject&#x2D;matter </span>off&#x2D;limits (or subjecting it to time&#x2D;place&#x2D;and&#x2D;manner restrictions) while not so limiting discussion of other issues or subjects. The case in the following example demonstrates restriction (2) in a context <span style="font-style:Italic;">not</span> involving signage.<br/></p><p class="_M1" id="95659"></a>Example&#x3A; <span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;">The New York Public Service Commission, using its power to regulate utilities, orders the utilities not to discuss, as part of their monthly billing materials, the </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">desirability of nuclear power. <br/></span></p><p class="_M2" id="97846"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;">Held</span>, this order violates the utilities&#x2019; right of free speech. &#x201c;The First Amendment&#x2019;s hostility to content&#x2D;based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">entire topic</span>.&#x201d; <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Consolidated Edison v.

Our entire system of representative government operates on the assumption that political and social change will come about peacefully, through public discussion, rather than through violence.<br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="22511"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dangerous speech&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="22379"></a> Yet, certain types of political speech may seem to most of us to pose a threat to the very system of representative democracy which freedom of speech is supposed to ensure. For instance, speech calling for immediate assassination of the President, or the institution of a military coup, seems dangerous to tolerate. However, once the government is permitted to prevent or punish some types of political speech, there arises the threat that those in power may also <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">stifle legitimate dissent. <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="22356"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_31259_123" name="XREF_31259_123">Advocacy of illegal conduct&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="44163"></a> Since early 2&#x30;th century, when the Supreme Court first began its serious grappling with the limits of valid political speech, the Court has generally tried to distinguish between, on the one hand, general <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">political dissent </span>and advocacy of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">abstract theories </span>(which may not be punished), and on the other hand, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">incitement</span> of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">particular illegal acts</span> (which constitutes an &#x201c;unprotected category,&#x201d; and may therefore be punished). But the Court has vacillated dramatically during this period in drawing the line between these two types of speech. Most commentators agree that the current standard, articulated in 1969 in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg v. Ohio</span>, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) (discussed <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_12377_123">495</a>) gives substantially greater protection to political speech than the various tests in force before it. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="8860"></a>B.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_41980_123" name="XREF_41980_123">The &#x201c;</a><a id="index_13753" name="index_13753"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Advocacy%20of%20illegal%20acts:“Clear%20and%20present%20danger”%20test%20for%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Advocacy%20of%20illegal%20acts:Clear%5D" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D"></a>clear <a id="index_13754" name="index_13754"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Clear%20and%20present%20danger”%20test%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Clear%5D" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D"></a>and present danger&#x201d; test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="8862"></a> For most of the 2&#x30;th century prior to <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span>, the dividing line between legal advocacy and illegal incitement of criminal acts was drawn by use of the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d;</span> test. Under this test, speech could be punished as an attempt to commit an illegal act if the speech created a &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; that the illegal act <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">would come about</span> (even if it never in fact occurred). <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="8864"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="8866"></a> The test was first articulated by Justice Holmes (speaking for a unanimous Court) in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Schenck v. U.S.,</span> 249 U.S. 47 (1919). The case arose in a wartime context, and involved the degree to which citizens had a constitutional right to oppose the First World War. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8868"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M1" id="35485"></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> In the 1917 Espionage Act, Congress made it a crime, </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:Italic;">inter alia</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;">, to &#x201c;willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States,&#x201d; or to &#x201c;willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service&#x201d; of the U.S. The defendants were not charged with violating the Act, but rather, with </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">conspiring</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> to violate it. The defendants had sent two draftees a document opposing the draft, calling it &#x201c;despotism,&#x201d; and urging the draftees, &#x201c;[d]o not submit to intimidation.&#x201d; But the document </span><span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">did not explicitly advocate illegal resistance</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> to the draft; it merely advocated </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">peaceful measures,</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> such as petitioning for repeal of the Conscription Act. <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="35507"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8874"></a> Nonetheless, the Court unanimously found that the defendants <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">could constitutionally be convicted </span>of conspiracy to violate the statute. Whether or not a given utterance is protected by the First Amendment depends, Holmes wrote, on the circumstances; the defendants&#x2019; document might have been constitutionally protected, for instance, in time of peace. The issue was &#x201c;whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">clear and present danger</span> that they will <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">bring about the substantive evils</span> that Congress has a right to prevent.&#x201d; Whether the defendants&#x2019; conduct in fact posed a &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; was a factual issue, the jury&#x2019;s disposition of which the Court refused to disturb. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8876"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Crying &#x201c;fire&#x201d; in theater&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M1" id="22411"></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> In his </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> opinion, Holmes illustrated his assertion that not all speech was constitutionally privileged by posing the now&#x2D;famous example of </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">falsely crying &#x201c;fire!&#x201d; in a crowded theater.<br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="8880"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Criticism&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="8882"></a> However, the nature of crying &#x201c;fire!&#x201d; in a crowded theater seems dramatically different from the speech in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span>; for one thing, the false cry of &#x201c;fire&#x201d; is clearly understood by its listeners to be a statement of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">fact,</span> not an exhortation or expression of opinion as the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span> document obviously was. Also, if one believes that the best way to combat false speech is by combatting it in the &#x201c;marketplace of ideas&#x201d; (a view espoused by Holmes himself in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Abrams v. U.S.</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_28940_123">491</a>), the two situations are clearly different&#x3A; there is not time to argue with the cry of &#x201c;fire!&#x201d;, but probably ample time to argue about the merits of conscription. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="8884"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Frohwerk </span>and<span style="font-style:Italic;"> Debs&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="8886"></a> Very shortly after <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span>, Justice Holmes wrote two more opinions, for a unanimous Court, upholding Espionage Act convictions against First Amendment arguments. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8888"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Frohwerk&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8890"></a> One of these, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Frohwerk v. U.S.</span>, 249 U.S. 2&#x30;4 (1919), involved writers of editorials criticizing the draft in a German&#x2D;language newspaper. Holmes&#x2019; opinion seemed to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">shift the burden of proof to the defendants</span> &#x2014; because of the lack of clarity of the record on appeal, it was &#x201c;impossible to say that it might not have been found&#x201d; that the publication might have been enough to &#x201c;kindle a flame&#x201d; of draft resistance. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8892"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_28351_123" name="XREF_28351_123" style="font-style:Italic;">Debs&#x3A;</a></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8894"></a> The other case, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Debs v. U.S.</span>, 249 U.S. 211 (1919) is perhaps even more disturbing to those who believe that general opposition to government policies, unaccompanied by explicit advocacy of illegal acts, ought to be protected by the First Amendment. The defendant in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Debs</span> was the well&#x2D;known socialist and presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, who made a speech opposing the First World War. Debs&#x2019; conviction of obstructing military recruitment was upheld by the Court. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="8896"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Weak standard&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="8898"></a> Although Holmes purported to be applying the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; standard, he phrased it as merely requiring that the words have as their <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;natural tendency and reasonably probable effect&#x201d;</span> the obstruction of recruitment. As in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span>, the Court refused to reject the jury&#x2019;s finding that Debs&#x2019; speech met this test. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="8900"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Criticism of<span style="font-style:Italic;"> Debs&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="8902"></a> The &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; standard which the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Debs</span> opinion purported to apply gave very little protection to Debs. There was, for instance, no evidence that any obstruction of recruitment actually occurred as a result of the speech. Holmes did not acknowledge that there was a difference between mailing anti&#x2D;draft leaflets <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">directly</span> to draftees (as in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span>) and addressing a general audience. Debs&#x2019; conviction was &#x201c;somewhat as though George McGovern had been sent to prison for his criticism of the war [in Vietnam].&#x201d; 4&#x30; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"></span><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">U.

U.S.,</span> 25&#x30; U.S. 616 (1919) that application of the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; standard was sufficient to produce even so much as a dissent against a conviction for anti&#x2D;war speech. In that case, Justice Holmes&#x2019; dissent (joined by Justice Brandeis) finally placed some First Amendment &#x201c;bite&#x201d; into the standard; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Abrams</span> is one of his best&#x2D;known dissents. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8908"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8910"></a> The defendants in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Abrams</span>, American socialists of Russian&#x2D;Jewish birth, were convicted of violating a newly&#x2D;added section of the Espionage Act, which prohibited the urging of any curtailment of war production with intent to hinder the United States&#x2019; prosecution of the War. The defendants had published two pro&#x2D;Bolshevik leaflets, which attacked the United States&#x2019; production and supplying of arms that might be used against Russia (against whom the U.S. had not declared war); neither leaflet was pro&#x2D;German, and in fact one was violently against German militarism. The leaflets urged workers not to make bullets which would be used not only against Germans but Russians as well. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8912"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Majority view&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8914"></a> The key factual issue in the case was whether the defendants had the requisite intent to interfere with the war effort <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">against Germany</span>. The majority conceded that the defendants&#x2019; <span style="font-style:Italic;">primary</span> purpose may have been only to aid the Russian Revolution. But &#x201c;[m]en must be held to have intended &#x2026; the effects which their acts were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">likely to produce</span>.&#x201d; Curtailment of production to protect Russians could not have been accomplished except by also impairing the war effort against Germany, the majority believed, so that the intent requirement was satisfied. (The majority also went out of its way to emphasize, repeatedly, that the defendants were self&#x2D;proclaimed &#x201c;anarchists.&#x201d;) <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8916"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holmes&#x2019; dissent&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8918"></a> Much of Holmes&#x2019; dissent was on the fairly pedestrian issue of intent. Unlike the majority, he believed that an actor does not &#x201c;intend&#x201d; a consequence &#x201c;unless that consequence is the aim of the deed.&#x201d; By this standard, the defendants simply had no intent to interfere with the war effort against Germany, however likely that possible outcome may have seemed to them. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="8924"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Value of free speech&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="8926"></a> But Holmes&#x2019; dissent is best known for its more general words about the value of free speech. He articulated what could be called the &#x201c;marketplace of ideas&#x201d; theory&#x3A; he urged <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;free trade in ideas,&#x201d;</span> and argued that &#x201c;[t]he best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market. &#x2026; &#x201d; The importance of allowing ideas to compete with each other, he argued, was so great that even opinions which we &#x201c;loathe and believe to be fraught with death&#x201d; should not be suppressed, &#x201c;unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="8928"></a>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Criticism of &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; doctrine&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="8930"></a> Holmes&#x2019; &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; doctrine has been criticized on a number of grounds. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8932"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Not very protective&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8934"></a> First, at least as it was applied in early cases, the doctrine obviously did not give very much protection to freedom of speech, since the defendants in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck, Frohwerk, Debs</span>, and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Abrams</span> were all convicted, without a showing that the words of any of them actually brought about a substantive evil. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8936"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Opinion about threat&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8938"></a> Second, the test, since it relies upon the fact&#x2D;finder&#x2019;s opinion about the immediacy of a specific threat (e.g., obstruction of military recruitment), makes political speech particularly vulnerable to the mass hysteria which tends to strike in times of national crisis. For instance, the test gave the least protection to speech during the First World War and during the McCarthy anti&#x2D;Communist scare, as discussed below. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8944"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Ineffectiveness rewarded&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8946"></a> Finally, the test seems to say that any kind of speech is permissible <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">as long as it is ineffective</span>, making the test a very peculiar way of carrying out the First Amendment notion of political change through peaceful speech rather than through violent <a id="index_13755" name="index_13755"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Advocacy%20of%20illegal%20acts:“Clear%20and%20present%20danger”%20test%20for%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Advocacy%20of%20illegal%20acts:Clear%5D" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D"></a>actio<a id="index_13756" name="index_13756"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Clear%20and%20present%20danger”%20test%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Clear%5D" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Clear%5D"></a>n. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="8948"></a>C.&#160;&#160;&#160; The Learned Hand test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="8950"></a> Because of these weaknesses in the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test, Judge Learned Hand, one of the greatest federal district and appeals court judges in our history, articulated a different test, one focusing <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">solely on the words spoken, not on the surrounding circumstances</span>. Hand&#x2019;s test was put forth in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten</span>, 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), a pre&#x2D;<span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span> decision. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="8952"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Terms of test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="8954"></a> Hand believed that words could be punished if they &#x201c;counsel or advise others to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">violate</span> the law as it stands,&#x201d; but not if they are merely <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">critical</span> of the law. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="8956"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Application&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="8958"></a> The speech at issue in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Masses</span> consisted of anti&#x2D;war cartoons and text which criticized the War and the draft, and which expressed great sympathy for draft resisters. Yet for Hand, this was still only <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">abstract advocacy</span> of the anti&#x2D;war position, not a direct call to violate the law. Consequently, he found the materials beyond Congress&#x2019; power to prohibit or punish. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="8960"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Significance&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="8962"></a> The main significance of Hand&#x2019;s test is that it makes the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">likely effects</span> of the speech <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">completely irrelevant</span>. Even if it were shown that the materials in fact caused many readers to resist the draft illegally, the publication would still be beyond Congress&#x2019; reach. By the same token, if the publication <span style="font-style:Italic;">did</span> constitute a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">direct call</span> to violate the law, it would be punishable <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">even if it was utterly ineffectual</span>. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="8996"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Fate of Hand test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="16333"></a> Hand&#x2019;s test was immediately rejected; not even the federal court of appeals in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Masses</span> itself was willing to affirm it. Instead, the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test prevailed for the next 5&#x30; years. But the Hand approach has ultimately had its day; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg v. Ohio (infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_12377_123">495</a>) incorporates the main aspects of that test, though it adds aspects of &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; as well. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="9000"></a>D.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_13757" name="index_13757"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Advocacy%20of%20illegal%20acts:Statutes%20directly%20proscribing%20speech" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Statutes_directly_proscribing_speech" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Statutes_directly_proscribing_speech"></a>Statutes directly proscribing speech&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="9002"></a> In the cases considered thus far, the legislature proscribed <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">acts</span>, not speech; speech became relevant only because the prosecution claimed that the speech constituted an attempt, or conspiracy, to bring about the forbidden act. Later, however, legislatures began enacting statutes which <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">directly forbade</span> certain types of speech. A major debate erupted on the Court about whether the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test applies to prosecutions under such statutes as well. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="9004"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Test not applied&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="9006"></a> The argument was won, at least temporarily, by those who claimed that the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no application</span> in this instance, and that the legislature&#x2019;s <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">own conclusion</span> that certain types of speech were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intrinsically dangerous</span> was to be respected. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="9008"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_27637_123" name="XREF_27637_123" style="font-style:Italic;">Gitlow&#x3A;</a></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="9010"></a> Thus in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Gitlow v. New York</span>, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), the Court construed the New York &#x201c;criminal anarchy&#x201d; statute, which banned advocating (orally or in writing) the overthrow of a government by assassination or other violent means. The defendant, a socialist, was involved in the publication of a &#x201c;Left&#x2D;wing Manifesto,&#x201d; which advocated establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat through mass strikes and other &#x201c;revolutionary mass action.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9012"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Majority view&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9014"></a> There was no showing at trial that the publication had posed any present danger of governmental overthrow or other substantive evil. Nonetheless, the majority <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">upheld</span> the defendant&#x2019;s conviction. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9016"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rationale&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9018"></a> The &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Schenck</span> was only to be applied &#x201c;in those cases where the statute merely prohibits certain <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">acts</span> involving the danger of substantive evil, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">without any reference to language</span> itself. &#x2026; &#x201d; Here, by contrast, the legislature had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">already</span> determined that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">certain types of language</span> (advocacy of violent overthrow of the government) posed a risk that substantive evils would result. It was not open to the Court to dispute the legislature&#x2019;s judgment and to conclude that, in a particular case, utterances coming within the statute were not dangerous. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9020"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; No immediacy requirement&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9022"></a> Furthermore, there was no requirement that the legislature proscribe only speech advocating <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">definite</span> or <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">immediate</span> action. Thus the defense that the Manifesto called only for action at some indefinite time in the future was unavailing. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9024"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9026"></a> A dissent by Justice Holmes (joined by Justice Brandeis) argued that the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">should</span> be applied on these facts. Under this test, he argued there should be no conviction because the Manifesto &#x201c;had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no chance</span> of starting a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">present conflagration</span>.&#x201d; But Holmes did not respond directly to the majority&#x2019;s argument that the test should not be applied where the legislature has directly forbidden certain types of speech. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="9028"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_26061_123" name="XREF_26061_123" style="font-style:Italic;">Whitney&#x3A;</a></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="9030"></a> The legislature&#x2019;s right to ban a certain type of speech, regardless of the substantive dangers posed by it, was presented again in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Whitney v.

Miss Whitney, who did not deny being a member of the Communist Labor Party, was convicted even though she did not agree with the Party&#x2019;s advocacy of violent means of change, and had in fact voted for a more temperate plank. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9036"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9038"></a> But a majority of the Court upheld the conviction, believing that the legislature&#x2019;s conclusion that mere knowing membership in an organization advocating criminal syndicalism was substantively dangerous, &#x201c;must be given great weight.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9040"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Brandeis&#x2019; dissent&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9042"></a> Justice Brandeis&#x2019; concurrence in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Whitney</span> (joined by Holmes) is one of his most eloquent on free speech. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9048"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; The value of free speech&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9050"></a> Brandeis&#x2019; concurrence is most remembered for its general discussion of the value of free speech. An orderly society <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">cannot be maintained merely through fear and enforced silence</span>, for &#x201c;fear breeds repression &#x2026; repression breeds hate &#x2026; [and] hate menaces stable government.&#x201d; On the contrary, &#x201c;the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies. &#x2026;  <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">[T]he fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones.</span>&#x201d; This might be thought of as the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;safety valve&#x201d;</span> theory of free speech (in contrast to the view that human expression is an end in itself, not merely a means to maintenance of order).<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9052"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Emergency&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9054"></a> For Brandeis, it followed that anytime bad ideas could be combatted by good ones, this combat, rather than suppression of the bad ideas, must be allowed to take place. Only where &#x201c;the incidence of the evil apprehended is so <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">imminent</span> that it may befall <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">before there is opportunity for full discussion</span>&#x201d; may speech be prohibited or punished. Furthermore, even if the danger is imminent, it may not be suppressed unless it is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;relatively serious&#x201d;</span>; for instance, advocacy of the right of pedestrians to cross unfenced vacant lands could not be prohibited, even if there were imminent danger that such advocacy would lead to trespass. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9056"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Concurrence&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9058"></a> However, Brandeis&#x2019; opinion was cast as a concurrence, not a dissent, because in Brandeis&#x2019; opinion the defendant had not raised the appropriate constitutional claims at the trial level. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9060"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Overruled&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9062"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> Whitney</span> was explicitly overruled in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg v.

The opinion, by Justice Vinson, purported to be applying the &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; test. However, the majority refused to interpret the test as requiring that there have been a clear and present danger of an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">actual attempt</span> to overthrow the government; the Holmes test &#x201c;cannot mean that before the Government may act, it must wait until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9092"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Adoption of Hand balancing test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9094"></a> Instead, the majority applied a test which had been formulated by Learned Hand, writing for the appeals court below&#x3A; the test was &#x201c;whether the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">gravity</span> of the ‘evil&#x2019;, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">discounted by its improbability,</span> justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.&#x201d; (Hand thus abandoned his <span style="font-style:Italic;">Masses</span> test, and instead tried to reshape the Holmes test.) Here, the evil (violent overthrow of the government) was so great that even a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">small, non&#x2D;imminent</span>, chance of success justified curtailing the speech. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9112"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Significance of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Dennis&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9114"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> Dennis</span> represents &#x201c;the temporary eclipse of the Holmes&#x2D;Brandeis formulation of the clear and present danger test.&#x201d; Tribe, p. 846.

This distinction is imposed by the requirement that the speech be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;directed&#x201d;</span> (i.e., <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intended</span>) to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;inciting</span> or <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">producing</span>&#x201d; an unlawful response. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9168"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Consequence&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9170"></a> Apparently, therefore, no speech that would have been protected by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">either</span> the Holmes or Hand tests may be prohibited under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg. <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9172"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Application to Ohio statute&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9174"></a> The significance of the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span> test is illustrated by the way the Court applied it to the Ohio statute at issue there. The Ohio act punished all advocacy of the &#x201c;duty, necessity or propriety of crime [or] violence &#x2026; as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform. &#x2026; &#x201d; This language was sufficiently broad that it forbade advocacy of the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">abstract doctrine</span> of violent political change, as well as incitement to imminent unlawful action. Therefore, it was held unconstitutional, even though some applications of it might have been constitutional (an illustration of the &#x201c;overbreadth&#x201d; doctrine, discussed below). <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="9176"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Severity of harm&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="9178"></a> The <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span> test does not explicitly take into account the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">severity</span> of the harm which is threatened. Reading <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span> literally, a speaker who advocated use of nuclear weapons for terrorist purposes, but only after a one&#x2D;year moratorium, could not be punished (since the harm would not be &#x201c;imminent&#x201d;). Conversely, one who incited his listeners to jaywalk immediately could be punished.

Bond, an opponent of the war in Vietnam, had joined a statement of &#x201c;sympathy with, and support [of] the men in this country who are unwilling to respond to a military draft.&#x201d; The Georgia House reasoned that Bond could not truthfully swear to &#x201c;support the Constitution of this State and of the United States.&#x201d; But the Court held that Bond could not be penalized for his statement, since it did not constitute a call for unlawful draft resistance, but was merely a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">general, abstract</span>, declaration of opposition to the war. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9192"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Watts&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9194"></a> A black anti&#x2D;war activist, in a speech, said &#x201c;[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle, the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.

In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Watts v.

The Court relied especially on the fact that the &#x201c;threat&#x201d; was conditional, and that the audience responded by laughter. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9196"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Hess&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9198"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> Bond, Watts</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span> were all decided during the Warren era.

Defendant then said &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take the fucking street later [or again].&#x201d; (The record was ambiguous as to the precise word used.) The Court found this to be protected speech, rather than an unprotected incitement to illegal action.

The plaintiffs were various American citizens and organizations that wanted to train members of these groups in how to use international law to resolve their disputes peacefully, and also wanted to engage in political advocacy on their behalf. The plaintiffs claimed that the statute was inconsistent with <span style="font-style:Italic;">Scales</span> &#x2014; they argued that it effectively made mere membership in the organization illegal, even if the member wanted to pursue only the organization&#x2019;s lawful aims.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="40059"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Statute upheld&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="40060"></a>By a 6&#x2D;3 vote, the Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">upheld</span> the statute against First Amendment attack. In an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court said that <span style="font-style:Italic;">Scales</span> was irrelevant, because that case did not deal with the issue of whether the giving of material support to an organization could constitutionally be forbidden. The statute here did not criminalize &#x201c;mere membership&#x201d; (as the one in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Scales</span> had done), but instead criminalized the giving of &#x201c;material support&#x201d; to the organization.

For instance, such support <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;frees up other resources within the organization </span>that may be put to violent ends.&#x201d; And that support &#x201c;helps<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> lend legitimacy </span>to foreign terrorist groups &#x2014; legitimacy that makes it easier for those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds &#x2014; all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="40063"></a><span class="BoldBody">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Statute is limited&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="40064"></a>But, Roberts asserted, the statute applied only to material support that was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;coordinated with or under the direction of&#x201d;</span> the designated terrorist organization, not &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">independent</span> advocacy that might be viewed as promoting the group&#x2019;s legitimacy.&#x201d; So <span style="font-style:Italic;">Holder</span> does not answer the question of whether Congress could make it a crime to engage in truly independent advocacy on behalf of a terrorist organization.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="40065"></a>iv.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="40066"></a> Three justices (Breyer, joined by Ginsburg and Sotomayor) dissented in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Holder</span>. They argued that the statute should be strictly scrutinized, because it authorized the criminal prosecution of those who engage in the communication and advocacy of political ideas. The dissenters were especially troubled by the majority&#x2019;s argument that the forbidden support &#x201c;helps lend legitimacy&#x201d; to terrorist groups; the dissenters believed that there was &#x201c;no natural stopping place&#x201d; once this argument was accepted &#x2014; &#x201c;speech, association and related activities on behalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to legitimate that group.&#x201d; <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="40068"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#x201c;Incitement&#x201d; law today&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="40069"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;">Holder</span> suggests that today, as we are actively waging the war on terror, the Supreme Court will be<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> quicker to uphold government restrictions on subversive or terrorist organizations</span> than it was in the relatively liberal 196&#x30;s era in which <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Scales</span> were decided. True, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Scales</span> technically remain the law&#x3A; mere advocacy of even violent political change cannot be forbidden unless the speaker is calling for imminent lawless action, and mere membership in even the most dangerous organization cannot be flatly prohibited.

The problem of selective enforcement exists in any statute. But the risk is greater in the case of an overbroad one, since the statute gives officials, by hypothesis, not only the opportunity to treat people differently (a problem with any statute, since it is always possible to prosecute only one of two people who may constitutionally be prosecuted), but also the chance to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">violate the constitutional rights</span> of one person without violating those of another. <br/></p><p class="_M1" id="9264"></a>Example&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> Assume that a town ordinance proscribes &#x201c;all demonstrations, involving 1&#x30;&#x30; or more persons, held in public streets.&#x201d; This ordinance by its terms applies both to activity which may constitutionally be proscribed (e.g., demonstrations that include violence or a substantial breach of the peace) as well as to those which may </span><span style="font-style:Italic;">not</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> be constitutionally prohibited (peaceful demonstrations, conducted at an appropriate time, without causing major interference with traffic).<br/></span></p><p class="_M2" id="9266"></a>Within the class of activities to which the statute may <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> constitutionally be applied, there is an open invitation to the police to allow their own views about acceptable content to color their decision.

It has done so principally by requiring that the overbreadth be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;substantial,&#x201d;</span> compared with the legitimate applications of the statute. This requirement was first set forth in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Broadrick v. Oklahoma</span>, 413 U.S. 6&#x30;1 (1973), a case which remains the best statement of the modern Court&#x2019;s view on overbreadth. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9284"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9286"></a> §818 of Oklahoma&#x2019;s Merit System Act prohibited civil servants from engaging in certain political activities, including taking part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign, and soliciting for campaign contributions. Broadrick, who had campaigned for a superior and had solicited money for him, challenged §818 on overbreadth (as well as vagueness) grounds. He pointed out that §818 had been construed as applying to such political expression as the wearing of political buttons and the displaying of bumper stickers, which (he asserted) were constitutionally&#x2D;protected free speech activities. Therefore, he contended, the section must be struck down, regardless of whether his own activity could have been constitutionally proscribed by a more narrowly&#x2D;drawn statute. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9288"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9290"></a> By a 5&#x2D;4 vote, the Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">rejected</span> Broadrick&#x2019;s claims, spending most of its time on the overbreadth one. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9292"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Speech vs. conduct&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9294"></a> The opinion distinguished between statutes primarily regulating conduct and those directly governing speech. In situations involving the latter, the Court did not modify the overbreadth rule. But in the case of statutes <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">governing conduct</span>, where the conduct happens to have an expressive content, the &#x201c;strong medicine&#x201d; of complete invalidation of the statute should not invariably be applied. Instead, the majority believed, for facial invalidation to be appropriate, &#x201c;the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial</span> as well, judged in relation to the statute&#x2019;s plainly legitimate sweep.&#x201d; Where the overbreadth is not substantial, unconstitutional applications should be rooted out one at a time, by analysis of the particular fact situations in which successive litigants find themselves. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9300"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Application&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9302"></a> The Oklahoma statue, under this analysis, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">did not call for overbreadth treatment</span>. The statute was primarily directed at <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">conduct</span> (taking part in a political campaign), not at pure speech. The statute was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not &#x201c;substantially overbroad,&#x201d;</span> since in the majority&#x2019;s judgment, it applied to a &#x201c;substantial spectrum of conduct&#x201d; that could constitutionally be subjected to state regulation. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9304"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Some protected applications&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9306"></a> The Court conceded that the statute by its terms could be applied to the wearing of political buttons or the use of bumper stickers, and that these might be constitutionally&#x2D;protected expressions. But such potential unconstitutional applications of the statute were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not numerous enough compared with the body of permissible applications</span>, so there was no &#x201c;substantial overbreadth.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9308"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_83172_123" name="XREF_83172_123"></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"></span><a style="font-weight:normal;"></a></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9310"></a> Since Broadrick&#x2019;s own conduct was clearly regulable rather than protected, the statute was upheld as applied to him. <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><a style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></a></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="9332"></a>e.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_78512_123" name="XREF_78512_123">Makes hard cases easy&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="9334"></a> The overbreadth doctrine, even with its requirement of &#x201c;substantial&#x201d; overbreadth, often has the effect of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">making &#x201c;hard&#x201d; cases into &#x201c;easy&#x201d; ones</span>.

The state common law of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) allows recovery for any &#x201c;outrageous and intentionally offensive&#x201d; language carried on a picket sign near the plaintiff&#x2019;s house.

One day he went to a park that was frequented by people on both sides of the immigration issue. Before a moderately interested audience of about 2&#x30; people, all of whom had come to the park for other purposes, Leonard began to make a speech. He said, &#x201c;If the federal government doesn&#x2019;t start doing a whole lot more to keep out illegal immigrants, we&#x2019;ll have to make &#x2019;em do it. Let&#x2019;s start by building up an arsenal of automatics and machine guns. Eventually, we&#x2019;ll have guerilla cells throughout the Southwest to make the federal government&#x2019;s life such a hell they&#x2019;ll build the kind of huge border fence we need.&#x201d; A few of the listeners applauded, one asked a question, but no one took any other action in apparent response to Leonard&#x2019;s speech. Immediately after his speech, Leonard was arrested by the police for violating §123 of a state statute. That statute provided that it is a felony to &#x201c;advocate insurrection against the state or federal government or any local subdivision thereof.&#x201d; Leonard now defends on the grounds that a conviction would violate his First Amendment rights. May Leonard constitutionally be convicted of violating the statute&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15452"></a>75. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="15453"></a>Robert was a tenured teacher in a public high school, in the state of Cartesia. He was also a member of NAMBLA, the National Association of Man Boy Love Affairs. NAMBLA&#x2019;s charter says that it is dedicated to the furtherance of social and sexual interaction between men and boys. Cartesia makes it a crime for an adult male to have sexual relations with a boy under the age of 17. Robert knows the aims of NAMBLA, and supports those aims; in fact, he himself has in the recent past had sexual relations with a boy. School officials, worried about recent publicity concerning teachers who belong to NAMBLA, asked Robert and all other teachers at the school to sign an affidavit stating that &#x201c;I am not now nor have I ever been a member of NAMBLA.&#x201d; (The affidavit said nothing else.) School officials announced that if a teacher did not sign the affidavit, they would consider that refusal to sign presumptive evidence of unfitness to be a teacher. Robert has so far refused to sign the affidavit. He wishes to challenge the constitutionality of the school&#x2019;s insistence that he sign. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15454"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> What is the strongest argument Robert can make as to why the affidavit requirement is unconstitutional&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15455"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b) </span>Will Robert&#x2019;s attack on the requirement&#x2019;s constitutionality succeed&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15460"></a>76. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="15461"></a>Becky, a young woman, walked topless on the boardwalk of Straitsville.

For purposes of this question, assume that it would be possible to draft a statute in such a way that it could constitutionally proscribe appearing topless in public.

However, government&#x2019;s right to do this is contingent on its behaving in a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content&#x2D;neutral</span> way. If government chooses to allow some messages and not allow others based on the content of the speech, then the restriction will be strictly scrutinized, and will be struck down unless it is&#x3A; (1) necessary to achieve a compelling objective; and (2) narrowly drawn to achieve that objective. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Widmar v. Vincent</span>. <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15813"></a>Here, government allows messages that pertain to matters under discussion inside the office building, but not messages pertaining to other matters. The government might defend on the grounds that it has not objected to the content of the messages, but has merely allowed some whole &#x201c;categories&#x201d; of speech while not allowing other whole categories. However, even distinctions among topics or categories is typically found to be content&#x2D;based. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Consolidated Edison v. Public Serv. Comm.</span> (state may not prevent utilities from discussing the issue of nuclear power&#x2019;s desirability, because &#x201c;[t]he First Amendment&#x2019;s hostility to content&#x2D;based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.&#x201d;) In any event, the speech here is taking place in a public forum, so the court will be especially reluctant to allow such a broad interference with it.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15819"></a>72. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15820"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes.</span> First, we need to analyze whether the restriction is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content&#x2D;based.</span> A regulation can be found to be content&#x2D;based even though it does <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> appear to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">favor any point of view</span> over another. Thus in addition to regulations that favor certain messages or points of view, content&#x2D;based regulations are defined so as to also include regulations that (a) <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">place a particular topic or subject matter off&#x2D;limits</span>, or (b) <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">require discussions of some topics or subject&#x2D;categories</span> to meet <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">more stringent time&#x2D;place&#x2D;and&#x2D;manner restrictions </span>than other topics or subject categories. [<span style="font-style:Italic;">Reed v. Town of Gilbert </span>(2&#x30;15)] [<a  href="#XREF_44508_123">483</a>&#x2D;<a  href="#XREF_18274__d__Rule_on_distinctions_between_various_subjects_or_t123">485</a>] A court would almost certainly say that the restriction here falls within category (b), since publications are treated differently depending on whether they discuss only a single subject or multiple subjects. Therefore, the court will almost surely classify the restriction here as content&#x2D;based.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="103396"></a>When government engages in content&#x2D;based regulation of expression, the restriction will be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strictly scrutinized</span>, and will be struck down unless it is&#x3A; (1) necessary to achieve a compelling objective; and (2) narrowly drawn to achieve that objective. It&#x2019;s very unlikely that the regulation here can survive that strict scrutiny. Even if the two objectives cited by the town (avoiding impairment of traffic flow during rush hour, and avoiding litter) are &#x201c;compelling,&#x201d; the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">means</span> chosen by the town (a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">complete ban</span> on the distribution of short single&#x2D;topic hand&#x2D;bills during rush hour) is deeply <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;underinclusive.&#x201d; </span>That is, the town has chosen <span style="font-style:Italic;">not</span> to restrict the distribution of free magazines and newspapers in the same places and time slots, even though that distribution poses essentially the same dangers. A dramatically underinclusive regulation will rarely be found to satisfy the very tight &#x201c;means&#x2D;end fit&#x201d; requirement imposed by strict scrutiny. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Reed v. Gilbert, supra</span>, striking down a town&#x2019;s tighter regulation of some types of signs than others, after the Court found that the regulation showed a fatal under&#x2D;inclusiveness similar to the one here.<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="48588"></a>73. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="48589"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> It would be a violation of the picketers&#x2019; First Amendment rights for them to be held liable under this statute, because such liability would effectively allow for content&#x2D;based regulation of the picketers&#x2019; speech, and cannot survive strict scrutiny. The case is comparable to <span style="font-style:Italic;">Snyder v. Phelps</span>, where picketers located on a public street who carried signs that intentionally offended the family of a soldier killed in Iraq were found to be shielded on First Amendment grounds from state&#x2D;court liability for IIED. <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15830"></a>74. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15831"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> The government may forbid a person from advocating illegal conduct, such as insurrection or overthrow of the government. However, under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Brandenburg v. Ohio</span>, speech advocating such illegality may only be proscribed if two conditions are satisfied&#x3A; (1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">imminent</span> lawless action; and (2) the advocacy is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">likely</span> to incite or produce such action. Here, neither of these requirements seems to be met. Leonard is not calling for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">imminent</span> illegality &#x2014; he says &#x201c;let&#x2019;s start &#x2026; ,&#x201d; but he does not indicate that action should take place immediately. Furthermore, although his statement about having guerilla cells could probably be interpreted as a call for illegality, his statement about &#x201c;building up an arsenal&#x201d; is not necessarily a call for illegality, since there are many legal ways to buy guns, even automatics and machine guns. Even if the court decides that Leonard was attempting to incite imminent lawless action, it is pretty clear that there was very little risk that his speech was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">likely</span> to produce that effect, since he had only a small crowd in front of him, they were in the park for other reasons, and they did not in fact respond with immediate illegal actions.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15837"></a>75. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15838"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">That it is overbroad.</span> A statute or regulation is overbroad if, in addition to proscribing activities which may constitutionally be forbidden, it also sweeps within its coverage future conduct which is protected by the guarantees of free speech or free association. <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15839"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, probably.</span> The government is clearly entitled to insist that Robert not commit crimes, and that he not advocate that others imminently commit crimes. However, the government may <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> make mere membership in an organization, without more, a crime, and it may not deprive a person of a government job or benefit for being merely a member or for refusing to say that he is not a member. Here, the affidavit merely requires Robert to say that he has not been a member; since Robert would be entitled to be a mere member of NAMBLA, so long as he did not agree with its aim of advocating imminent commission of the crime of man&#x2D;boy love, the affidavit requirement would punish some membership that is constitutional. Robert&#x2019;s own membership here is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> constitutionally protected, since he in fact knows of NAMBLA&#x2019;s stated aims and supports those (illegal) aims. But under the overbreadth doctrine, Robert is permitted to say, in effect, &#x201c;The affidavit requirement would be unconstitutional if applied to (hypothetical) other people who merely belong to NAMBLA without supporting its criminal aims, so it should be struck down as facially invalid.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15840" style="text-indent : 10.80pt;"></a>Under the requirement of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;substantial</span> overbreadth,&#x201d; the overbreadth doctrine would not be applied unless the invalid applications of the requirement are substantial compared to the legitimate applications. Here, however, this requirement of substantial overbreadth is probably satisfied, since quite a number of people are likely to belong to NAMBLA just to get information about the law and politics surrounding this question rather than to advocate or practice illegal man&#x2D;boy sex. Therefore, Robert&#x2019;s overbreadth attack will probably succeed.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15846"></a>76. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15847"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">That the statute is unconstitutionally vague.</span> <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15848"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, probably.</span> A statute will be held void for vagueness if the conduct forbidden by it is so unclearly defined that a person of ordinary intelligence would not know what is forbidden.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15849" style="text-indent : 10.80pt;"></a>Here, the statute uses the words &#x201c;lewd or lascivious,&#x201d; but furnishes no further information about what type of conduct is being forbidden. A reasonable observer would probably be in doubt as to whether it is necessarily lewd for a woman to appear topless. Because of the ordinance&#x2019;s lack of specificity, undue discretion is given to local law enforcement officials, who depending on how they felt about Becky or toplessness generally could decide to look the other way rather than making an arrest. Therefore, while the city might be entitled to ban women from appearing topless in public if the ordinance specifically applied to toplessness, the formulation here is probably unconstitutionally vague.  <br/></p><p class="_QEnd" id="35417"></a><br/></p><p class="_L2Capt" id="9368" style="margin-top : 14.00pt;"></a>IV.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_13779" name="index_13779"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Time,%20place%20and%20manner”%20regulations%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Time%5D" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Time%5D" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Time%5D"></a>REGULATION OF CONTEXT &#x2014; &#x201c;TIME, PLACE AND MANNER&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="9370"></a>A.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_14763_123" name="XREF_14763_123">Context regulations generally&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="9372"></a> Recall that the state is somewhat more free to regulate expression when it does so for reasons independent of the speech&#x2019;s communicative content (a &#x201c;track two&#x201d; situation) than where the regulation is motivated by the expression&#x2019;s content (the &#x201c;track one&#x201d; case). Or, to put it another way, the state is substantially freer when it acts in a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content&#x2D;neutral</span> manner. This section discusses various factual settings in which the state has claimed (not always successfully) that it is merely regulating the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;time, place and manner&#x201d;</span> of speech and is therefore entitled to &#x201c;track two&#x201d; analysis. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="9374"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rules for &#x201c;track two&#x201d; cases&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="9376"></a> In general, the Court has applied a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">balancing test</span> to determine whether the government&#x2019;s interest in content&#x2D;neutral regulation of speech&#x2D;related conduct outweighs the speaker&#x2019;s (or his listeners&#x2019;) interest in a particular form of communicative activity. But in performing this balancing test, the Court in effect places a &#x201c;thumb on the scale&#x201d; on the side of free expression, to reflect the exceptional importance of such expression. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="9378"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Disproportionate impact&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="9380"></a> In performing the balancing test, the court will take into account the extent to which the regulation &#x201c;falls <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">unevenly upon various groups</span> in &#x2026; society.&#x201d; Tribe, p. 98&#x30;. For instance, the poor cannot generally afford television spots or full&#x2D;page newspaper announcements; they must use cheaper means such as demonstrations, leafletting and door&#x2D;to&#x2D;door canvassing.

This, coupled with the fact that no regulation has been upheld under the fighting words exception since <span style="font-style:Italic;">Feiner</span> in 1951, may render the doctrine largely irrelevant. <span style="font-weight:Bold;"><a id="index_52018" name="index_52018"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Fighting%20words”%20doctrine%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Fighting%5D" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Fighting%5D" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Fighting%5D"></a><br/></span></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="9786"></a>I.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_13814" name="index_13814"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Offensive%20words" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Offensive_words" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Offensive_words"></a><a id="XREF_28928_123" name="XREF_28928_123">Offensive words and the sensitive audience&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="9787"></a> A related issue is whether the government may prevent or punish words which listeners will find <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">offensive</span>, even though these words are not likely to lead to actual violence.

California</span>, 4&#x30;3 U.S. 15 (1971). The case stands basically for the proposition that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">profane, offensive language is nonetheless First Amendment speech</span>, and may not be suppressed under the guise of regulating the &#x201c;manner&#x201d; of speech. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9796"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9797"></a> Cohen wore a jacket bearing the legend &#x201c;Fuck the Draft&#x201d; in a corridor of the Los Angeles County Courthouse, where women and children were present. He was convicted of violating a statute prohibiting the intentional &#x201c;disturb[ing] the peace or quiet of any &#x2026; person [by] offensive conduct.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9798"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Conviction reversed&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9799"></a> The Court, in a classic opinion by Justice Harlan, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">reversed the conviction</span> on First Amendment grounds. In so doing, Harlan rejected a number of arguments advanced by the state. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9800"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Not obscene&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9801"></a> Harlan found that the legend on the jacket was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not obscene</span>. An expression is obscene only if it is &#x201c;in some significant way, erotic.&#x201d; No erotic &#x201c;psychic stimulation&#x201d; could reasonably have been expected to result when anybody read the jacket. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9802"></a>iv.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_13815" name="index_13815"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Captive%20audience" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Captive_audience" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Captive_audience"></a>Not &#x201c;captive audience&#x201d;&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9803"></a> The state claimed that <span style="font-style:Italic;">Cohen&#x2019;s</span> message had been &#x201c;thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers,&#x201d; and that the state had the power to protect such <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;captive audiences&#x201d;</span> from offensive language. But Harlan&#x2019;s opinion took a narrow view of what constitutes a true &#x201c;captive audience.&#x201d; Those in the courthouse could have &#x201c;avoid[ed] further bombardment of their senses simply by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">averting their eyes</span>.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="9804"></a>v.&#160;&#160;&#160; Right to purge offensive language&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="9805"></a> Lastly, Harlan rejected the state&#x2019;s most general claim, that it had the right to ban certain expletives in order to &#x201c;maintain what [officials] regard as a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">suitable level of discourse</span> within the body politic.&#x201d; He stressed that the First Amendment&#x2019;s general function is to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;remove governmental restraints for the arena of public discussion.&#x201d;</span> Only where speech falls within relatively narrow pre&#x2D;established categories may government regulate its form or content; none of these exceptions was applicable here. But Harlan also found more specific reasons for finding that the state could not ban expressions like Cohen&#x2019;s from public discourse&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="9806"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>No stopping point&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="9807"></a> First, there was no principled way to distinguish &#x201c;fuck&#x201d; from other words. Yet the state clearly did not have the right to &#x201c;cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us.&#x201d; The preferable constitutional result was simply to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">leave matters of &#x201c;taste and style&#x201d; to the individual</span>, especially since &#x201c;[o]ne man&#x2019;s vulgarity is another&#x2019;s lyric.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="9808"></a><span class="BoldBody">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Emotional content&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="9809"></a> Secondly, this was not simply a situation in which Cohen chose vulgar words to express an idea that could have been equally well expressed by more polite language. The language chosen by Cohen, like much expression, conveyed not only an intellectual idea, but also <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;otherwise inexpressible emotions.&#x201d;</span> The Constitution protects this <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;emotive function&#x201d;</span> of speech just as much as the cognitive content of expression. <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="9810"></a><span class="BoldBody">(3)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span><a id="XREF_35085_123" name="XREF_35085_123">Smokescreen for censorship&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="9811"></a> Finally, governments might often ban particular words as a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">smokescreen</span> for banning the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">expression of unpopular views</span>. &#x201c;One [cannot] forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="44942"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_49476" name="index_49476"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Intentional%20infliction%20of%20emotional%20distress" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress"></a>Emotionally hurtful speech&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="44979"></a>A second important category of speech that is entitled to full First Amendment protection even though offensive is speech that is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">emotionally hurtful</span> to the listener. No matter how much psychic pain the speech inflicts &#x2014; indeed, is <span style="font-style:Italic;">intended</span> to inflict &#x2014; on the listener, the speech gets<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> full First Amendment protection</span>, as long as <br/></p><p class="Bullet2dPar" id="45111" style="margin-left : 72.00pt;margin-top : 6.00pt;text-indent : -18.00pt;"></a>[1]&#160;&#160;&#160;The speech is on a matter of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public </span>(not purely private) <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">interest</span>; and <br/></p><p class="Bullet2dPar" id="45118" style="margin-left : 72.00pt;margin-top : 6.00pt;text-indent : -18.00pt;"></a>[2]&#160;&#160;&#160;The pain comes from the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content</span> of the message (i.e., the attempted state regulation is &#x201c;content&#x2D;based&#x201d; as discussed <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_track_one_cross-ref123">477</a>). <br/></p><p class="_L6SecondPar" id="45089"></a>A 2&#x30;11 case striking down a state&#x2019;s right to allow recovery for speech that under state law constituted <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intentional infliction of emotional distress</span> (IIED) is the leading illustration of this principle. That case, which upheld the First Amendment right of picketers to use hateful speech to attack the character of a dead soldier at his funeral, is <a id="XREF_Snyder_v_Phelps_cross-ref123" name="XREF_Snyder_v_Phelps_cross-ref123"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Snyder v.

The church members&#x2019; core belief was that God hates homosexuality and hates (and punishes) the U.S. military for tolerating homosexuality. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="45291"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Protest strategy&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="45302"></a>The church members&#x2019; main First Amendment activity has long been to picket military funerals. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Snyder</span> grew out of one such picketing session, in which the church members carried hateful signs on public land adjacent to the Maryland funeral of a Marine Lance Colonel killed in Iraq, Matthew Snyder. Matthew&#x2019;s father, Albert Snyder, saw the signs on a TV broadcast after the funeral and became severely distressed at their content. He brought a federal&#x2D;court diversity action based on substantive Maryland law for the tort of IIED. He ultimately obtained a civil judgment for &#x24;4 million in combined compensatory and punitive damages against the church members. The issue was whether that &#x2014; or indeed any &#x2014; civil judgment could be enforced without violating the church members&#x2019; First Amendment rights. (The Supreme Court&#x2019;s answer turned out to be a very clear &#x201c;no,&#x201d; as we&#x2019;ll see.)<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="45348"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Hateful signs&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="45355"></a>The picketers at the Snyder funeral carried signs with messages like &#x201c;God Hates the USA&#47;Thank God for 9&#47;11,&#x201d; &#x201c;God hates fags,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Thank God for Dead Soldiers.&#x201d; The picketers&#x2019; message was apparently that Matthew and other soldiers had been killed in combat because God wanted to punish the United States for tolerating homosexuality.

Picketing took place 1,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; feet from the church where the funeral was held; none of the church members ever entered the church or the cemetary, or in any way interfered with the funeral. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="45332"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; The Ds win&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="45421"></a>In an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts that seven members of the Court (all but Alito) joined, the Court held that allowing Matthew&#x2019;s father Albert to recover any damages at all would be a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">violation</span> of the Ds&#x2019; First Amendment right to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">speak freely on a matter of public interest.<br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="45195"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; The test&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="45430"></a>Roberts began by saying that whether the First Amendment prohibited holding the church members liable for their speech &#x201c;turns largely on whether the speech is of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public</span> or <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">private</span> concern.&#x201d; Speech on matters of &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public</span> concern&#x201d; is &#x201c;at the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">heart</span> of the First Amendment&#x2019;s protection&#x201d; and &#x201c;occupies the<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> highest rung</span> of the hierarchy of First Amendment values [making it] entitled to special protection.&#x201d; By contrast, if the speech involved solely a &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">purely private</span> matter,&#x201d; it would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;not implicate the same constitutional concerns&#x201d; </span>because there would be &#x201c;no potential <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">interference with a meaningful dialogue of ideas.&#x201d;</span> <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="45557"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Public concern&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="45564"></a>Roberts then quickly concluded that the speech here was indeed on a matter of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public</span> concern. Speech involves a matter of public concern when it either (1) &#x201c;can be fairly considered as relating to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">any matter of political, social, or other concerns to the community,</span>&#x201d; or (2) &#x201c;is a subject of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">legitimate news interest.</span>&#x201d; The fact that the statement is &#x201c;inappropriate or controversial&#x201d; is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">irrelevant</span> to the question of whether it involves a matter of public concern. The messages on the picket signs here &#x201c;may fall short of refined social or political commentary&#x201d; but those messages were clearly designed to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">speak on a broad public issue</span>, and indeed, to reach as broad a public audience as possible. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="45599"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Content&#x2D;based rather than content&#x2D;neutral&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="45649"></a>Roberts was also in no doubt about whether the governmental regulation here (namely, the availability of a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">tort recovery</span> under state law) was of the forbidden<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> content&#x2D;based </span>variety rather than an easier&#x2D;to&#x2D;justify <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content&#x2D;neutral</span> &#x201c;time, place and manner&#x201d; regulation.

Scalia conceded that the state had a compelling interest in safeguarding the rights of traditionally&#x2D;disfavored groups, including their right to live in peace where they wish. But he argued that the ordinance was not <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;necessary&#x201d; </span>to achieve this state interest, because there were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;adequate content&#x2D;neutral alternatives.&#x201d; </span>In particular, St. Paul could enact an ordinance prohibiting <span style="font-style:Italic;">all<a id="index_31339" name="index_31339"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Fighting%20words”%20doctrine%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Fighting%5D" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Fighting%5D" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Fighting%5D"></a></span> fighting words, not merely fighting words motivated by racial, religious or other specifically&#x2D;enumerated biases. To Scalia, burning a cross in someone&#x2019;s front yard is &#x201c;reprehensible,&#x201d; but St. Paul had &#x201c;sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behaviour without adding the First Amendment to the fire.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="31340"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Concurrence&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="31341"></a> The main concurrence in <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V.</span> (by Justice White, joined by Blackmun, O&#x2019;Connor and, in most respects, Stevens) read more like a dissent. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="31342"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Unprotected categories&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="31343"></a> Justice White believed that where a category is &#x201c;unprotected,&#x201d; the states are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> prevented from regulating it on the basis of content. &#x201c;It is inconsistent to hold that the government may proscribe an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">entire category</span> of speech because the content of that speech is evil &#x2026; but that the government may not treat a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">subset of that category differently</span> without violating the First Amendment; the content of the subset is by definition worthless and undeserving of constitutional protection.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="31346"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Overbreadth&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="31347"></a>But White nonetheless agreed with the result in the case. White believed that the case should instead have been decided on <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">overbreadth</span> grounds. He interpreted the Minnesota court to have ruled that the ordinance prohibited expression that &#x201c;by its very utterance&#x201d; causes &#x201c;anger, alarm or resentment.&#x201d; By this interpretation, the ordinance reached not only words tending to incite an immediate breach of the peace (words which may constitutionally be proscribed), but also words and expressive conduct that cause <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">only</span> hurt feelings, offense, or resentment (words and conduct which may not be constitutionally proscribed). Since the ordinance reached both protected and unprotected speech, it was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">overbroad</span>, and thus invalid.   <span style="font-weight:Bold;"><a id="index_49511" name="index_49511"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3ECROSS%20BURNING" id="%3C$endrange%3ECROSS_BURNING" name="%3C$endrange%3ECROSS_BURNING"></a> </span><a id="index_49610" name="index_49610"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Cross%20burning" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Cross_burning" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Cross_burning"></a><br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="31360"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_31358" name="index_31358"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Hate%20speech,”%20regulation%20of:Penalty-enhancement%20statutes%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Hate%5D" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Hate%5D" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Hate%5D"></a><a id="XREF_35799_123" name="XREF_35799_123">Enhancement&#x2D;of&#x2D;penalty statutes&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="51296"></a>The Court&#x2019;s approach in <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V.</span> invalidates many anti&#x2D;hate crime statutes that, like St. Paul&#x2019;s, define certain activities as a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">new, separate, crime</span>.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="51307"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Enhancement&#x2D;of&#x2D;penalty statutes may be valid&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="51331"></a>But <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V.</span> does <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not invalidate</span> statutes that approach the hate&#x2D;speech problem in a quite different way&#x3A; these statutes punish <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">existing crimes</span> like vandalism and arson <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">more seriously</span> if the prosecution shows that the crime was motivated in part by one of the listed types of bias.

This unanimous decision seems to validate all of the dozens of state and local hate&#x2D;crime laws of the &#x201c;penalty enhancement&#x201d; variety throughout the country. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="31363"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="31364"></a> In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Wisconsin v. Mitchell</span>, D, a black teenager, was convicted of aggravated battery, a crime that in Wisconsin ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. However, there was strong evidence that D had selected his victim, V, based on race; for instance, he pointed to V, told his friends, &#x201c;There goes a white boy; go get him,&#x201d; then led them in a severe beating of V. Under Wisconsin&#x2019;s statute, the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">maximum sentence </span>for aggravated battery was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">increased</span> to seven years because of D&#x2019;s race&#x2D;based selection of a victim. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="31365"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Statute upheld&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="31366"></a> The Court unanimously held that this penalty&#x2D;enhancement scheme did not violate D&#x2019;s First Amendment rights, and thus <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">upheld</span> the statute. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="31367"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Defendant&#x2019;s argument&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="31368"></a> D argued in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mitchell</span> that since the only reason for the enhanced sentence was his discriminatory motive for selecting his victim, the statute punished his beliefs. Therefore, he argued, the penalty&#x2D;enhancement statute was no more constitutionally acceptable than the ban on certain &#x201c;fighting words&#x201d; struck down in <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V.</span> <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="31369"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Speech&#47; conduct distinction&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="31370"></a>But the Court rejected this argument. In doing so, the Court relied heavily on the distinction between speech and conduct. The ordinance struck down in <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V.</span> was explicitly directed at expression, whereas the penalty&#x2D;enhancement statute here was aimed at <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">conduct</span>, and this conduct was completely unprotected by the First Amendment. (That is, there is no constitutional protection for the act of battery, whatever the actor&#x2019;s motive.)<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="31371"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Analogy to anti&#x2D;discrimination laws&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="31372"></a>The Court also observed that many other statutes punish a defendant based on his motive for acting. For instance, federal Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee &#x201c;because of such individual&#x2019;s race, color, religion, sex,  &#x2026; ,&#x201d; yet that statute has always been found to conform with the First Amendment.<br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="31485"></a>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_32880" name="index_32880"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Intimidation%20as%20non-protected%20activity" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intimidation_as_non-protected_activity" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intimidation_as_non-protected_activity"></a>Ban on all acts intended to intimidate&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="31487"></a> Finally, in the most recent cutting back on the general rule of <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V.</span>, the Court has held that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">all instances</span> of a certain type of expressive act &#x2014; such as cross&#x2D;burning &#x2014; may be prohibited if done for the purpose of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intimidation or threat</span>, even if other intimidating acts with expressive content are not prohibited. <a id="XREF_Virginia_v__Black_case123" name="XREF_Virginia_v__Black_case123" style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Virginia v.

But there were separate majorities for two propositions&#x3A; (1) that government may <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">single out cross burning</span> as a particularly virulent form of intimidation, and may thus <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">ban all cross burnings done with intent to intimidate</span> even while not banning other expressive acts intended to intimidate; and (2) that the statute here was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">unconstitutional</span> (though no majority agreed about why). <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="31501"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Government may single out cross&#x2D;burning&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="31503"></a> As to proposition (1), a majority of the Court in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Black</span> agreed that &#x201c;[i]nstead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">regulate this subset of intimidating messages</span> in light of cross burning&#x2019;s long and pernicious history as a<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> signal of impending violence.</span>&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="31521"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Significance&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="31523"></a> <span style="font-style:Italic;">Black</span> is significant mainly for the proposition that a properly&#x2D;constructed statute may <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">ban a</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">particular type of intimidating expression</span> &#x2014; such as cross burning &#x2014; while <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">declining to ban other types of intimidating expressions</span>. <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;"><a id="index_49640" name="index_49640"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:“Hate%20speech,”%20regulation%20of%5BFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Hate%5D" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Hate%5D" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Hate%5D"></a> <a id="index_49655" name="index_49655"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Intimidation%20as%20non-protected%20activity" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intimidation_as_non-protected_activity" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intimidation_as_non-protected_activity"></a> <a id="index_49735" name="index_49735"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3E“HATE%20SPEECH”:Regulation%20of%20as%20First%20Amendment%20violation%5BHATE%20SPEECH:Regulation%20of%20as%20First%20Amendment%20violation%5D" id="%3C$endrange%3E“HATE_SPEECH”_Regulation_of_as_First_Amendment_violation%5D" name="%3C$endrange%3E“HATE_SPEECH”_Regulation_of_as_First_Amendment_violation%5D"></a><br/></span></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="9898"></a>K.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_57852_123" name="XREF_57852_123"></a><a id="XREF_11586_123" name="XREF_11586_123"></a><a id="XREF_26738_123" name="XREF_26738_123"></a><a id="XREF_39293_123" name="XREF_39293_123"></a><a id="index_31382" name="index_31382"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Campus%20speech,%20regulation%20of" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Campus_speech,_regulation_of" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Campus_speech,_regulation_of"></a><a id="index_27531" name="index_27531"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Indecency,%20regulation%20of" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Indecency,_regulation_of" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Indecency,_regulation_of"></a>All speech not necessarily created equal (the disfavoring of indecent speech)&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="24407"></a> Implicit in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Cohen v.

American Civil Liberties Union</span>, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). The plaintiffs attacked two provisions of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA).

(For easy reference, we&#x2019;ll call the first provision the &#x201c;knowing transmission&#x201d; provision and the second the &#x201c;make available&#x201d; provision.) Both provisions were directed mainly at the Internet.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="32935"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Unanimously struck down&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="33095"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> </span>All nine Justices agreed that at least parts of the CDA were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">unconstitutional</span>. The Court&#x2019;s opinion was by Justice Stevens, who found the CDA to be both overly vague and overbroad.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="33096"></a><span class="BoldBody">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Less risk of intrusion&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="33097"></a> Stevens concluded that the burden on government to justify content regulation of the Internet was much greater than for such regulation of over&#x2D;the&#x2D;air broadcasting. Over&#x2D;the&#x2D;air broadcasting merited regulation in part because there was no way to adequately <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">protect the listener from unexpected messages.</span> By contrast, the risk that a computer user would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">stumble upon</span> indecent material by accident was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;remote,&#x201d;</span> because &#x201c;a series of affirmative steps is required to access specific material.&#x201d; So cases allowing tight regulation of indecency in the over&#x2D;the&#x2D;air context (like <span style="font-style:Italic;">FCC v. Pacifica</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_FCC_v__Pacifica_Foundation_cross-ref123">640</a>) furnished no support for a finding that the CDA was constitutional.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="55658"></a><span class="BoldBody">(3)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Statute found overbroad&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="55659"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> </span>Stevens concluded that the statute was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">overbroad</span>, because it restricted the free&#x2D;speech rights of <span style="font-style:Italic;">adults</span>. &#x201c;In order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">adults have a constitutional right to receive </span>and to address to one another.&#x201d; For instance, if one member of a 1&#x30;&#x30;&#x2D;person chat group was a minor, the entire group would be foreclosed from discussing an &#x201c;indecent&#x201d; topic, even though the 99 adults clearly had a right to discuss that topic. <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="32947"></a><span class="BoldBody">(4)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Fails strict scrutiny&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="32949"></a> This suppression of protected adult speech had to survive <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strict scrutiny</span>, Stevens said. Therefore, the government had to show that there was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no less restrictive alternative</span> that would accomplish the same ends. The government had failed to carry this burden, he concluded. For instance, the government might have just imposed the less&#x2D;restrictive alternative that indecent material be &#x201c;tagged&#x201d; so that user&#x2D;installed filters could block it.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="32951"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Replacement statute is also found invalid&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="32953"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> After </span><span style="font-style:Italic;font-size : 12.00pt;">Reno</span><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;">, </span>Congress tried to fix the CDA&#x2019;s constitutional problems by enacting a replacement statute, the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Child Online Protection Act (COPA)</span>.

(Minors were defined as persons under 17.)  Web operators were given an affirmative defense if they screened minors from access by some <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">age&#x2D;verification mechanism</span>, such as by requiring a credit card or by &#x201c;any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology.&#x201d; So basically, COPA said that anyone who wanted to operate a commercial Web site containing material that might be harmful to minors had to impose a mechanism for checking that only adults used the site.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="32960"></a><span class="BoldBody">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Lower court issues injunction&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="32962"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> A</span> federal district court issued a preliminary injunction against COPA, on the grounds that it, like the CDA before it, violated the First Amendment rights of adults.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="32964"></a><span class="BoldBody">(3)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Supreme Court agrees with injunction&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="32966"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> B</span>y a 5&#x2D;4 vote, the Supreme Court held that the lower&#x2D;court had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not abused its discretion in entering the injunction.</span> Justice Kennedy&#x2019;s opinion for the majority began by repeating <span style="font-style:Italic;">Reno</span>&#x2019;s holding that if a statute suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive, the government must bear the burden of showing that there are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no less&#x2D;restrictive alternatives</span> that would be at least as effective.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="32968"></a><span class="BoldBody">(4)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Filtering not shown to be less effective&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="32970"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> </span>Kennedy concluded that the government had not borne this burden of proof here. In particular, he focused on <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;blocking and filtering software&#x201d; </span>that could voluntarily be installed by users on their own computers. Such filtering software would clearly be less restrictive than the age&#x2D;verification scheme required by COPA; for instance, an adult with children could simply turn off the filter when the adult wanted to use the computer. Therefore, the injunction should be permitted to stand while the case was tried on the merits, and the statute would be found valid only if the government could show (as seemed very unlikely) that the statute was in fact the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">least&#x2D;restrictive available means of effectively blocking minors</span> from accessing indecent Internet material.<br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="32972"></a><span class="BoldBody">(5)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Dissent&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="32974"></a> The four dissenters, led by Justice Breyer, believed that COPA did indeed satisfy the least&#x2D;restrictive&#x2D;alternative requirement.

Suppose further that Facebook learns that P is such an offender, and cancels his user ID under the terms of service. Can P argue that First Amendment principles (or perhaps common&#x2D;law &#x201c;public policy&#x201d; principles inspired by the First Amendment) prevent Facebook from imposing this restriction on him given that government wouldn&#x2019;t be allowed to do so&#x3F;<br/></span></p><p class="_M2_M4Text_" id="108623"></a>It seems clear that P will <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">lose</span> with this argument.

Most significantly, the Court found a substantial governmental interest in &#x201c;maintaining the parks in the heart of our capital in an attractive and intact condition,&#x201d; and concluded that the ban on sleeping furthered this interest by limiting the extent and duration of demonstrations like the one involved here. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10218"></a>B.&#160;&#160;&#160; Flag <a id="index_13908" name="index_13908"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Flag%20desecration%20and%20misuse" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Flag_desecration_and_misuse" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Flag_desecration_and_misuse"></a>desecration&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="10219"></a> One context in which the right of symbolic speech is important is the area of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">flag desecration</span>&#x3A; nearly all states (as well as the federal government) make it a crime to mutilate or otherwise desecrate an American flag.

At the end of the demonstration, he unfurled an American flag, doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire. While the flag burned, the protestors chanted, &#x201c;America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.&#x201d; Johnson was charged with violating the desecration statute; at his trial, several witnesses testified that they had been seriously offended by the flag burning, and he was convicted. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10226"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10227"></a> By a 5&#x2D;4 vote, the Court held that the Texas statute violated the First Amendment as applied to Johnson&#x2019;s acts. The majority opinion was written by Justice Brennan. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="10228"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#x201c;Track one&#x201d; analysis&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="10229"></a> The key to the result reached by the majority was that the Court applied what we have called &#x201c;track one&#x201d; analysis. That is, the majority determined that the prosecution of Johnson was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;directly related to expression.&#x201d;</span> In reaching this conclusion, the Court reviewed the two objectives that Texas asserted it was pursuing&#x3A; (1) preventing breaches of the peace; and (2) preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. As to objective (1), the majority simply disbelieved that preventing breaches of the peace was what had motivated Texas on these facts (since no disturbance of the peace either actually occurred or was threatened by this particular flag burning). As to objective (2), the need to protect the flag as a symbol of national unity would only be implicated if the defendant&#x2019;s conduct had a contrary message associated with it, so this objective was &#x201c;directly related to expression&#x201d; and thus called for track one scrutiny. The content&#x2D;based nature of the statute was illustrated by the fact that particular conduct was covered only if an observer&#x2019;s likely reaction would be to be &#x201c;seriously offended&#x201d; &#x2014; the offense could only flow from the message accompanying the act. (For instance, if D had burned the flag as a means of respectfully disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he would not have offended anyone, and he would not have been convicted under the statute.) <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="10230"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Strict scrutiny applied&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="10231"></a> Since Johnson was prosecuted only because of the content of the particular message he was conveying, the Court applied strict scrutiny to the statute. &#x201c;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.&#x201d; Here, Texas&#x2019;s objective &#x2014; preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity &#x2014; may have been worthy, even &#x201c;compelling.&#x201d; But the means chosen by Texas to serve that objective were not necessary ones. First, the majority didn&#x2019;t believe that the nation&#x2019;s belief in the cherished significance of the flag would be undermined by acts of mutilation; indeed, these acts might produce the opposite result. Second, the government could combat such acts by acts of its own, such as giving the remains of the flag a respectful burial (as one witness to Johnson&#x2019;s burning did). <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10232"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10233"></a> Four members of the Court bitterly dissented. The principal dissent was by Justice Rehnquist (joined by White and O&#x2019;Connor). The dissenters thought that a state could prohibit the burning of a flag without violating the First Amendment prohibition on suppression of ideas. &#x201c;The flag is not simply another ‘idea&#x2019; or ‘point of view&#x2019; competing for recognition in the market place of ideas.&#x201d; Also, the dissenters thought that flag burning is so inherently inflammatory that it inevitably threatens a breach of the peace, and thus could be analogized to &#x201c;fighting words&#x201d; and deprived of First Amendment protection entirely. In a separate dissent, Justice Stevens thought that the flag, even though it is in a sense an intangible asset, could be protected from desecration just as, say, the Lincoln Memorial could be protected from having a political message spray&#x2D;painted upon it. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10234"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_13909" name="index_13909"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Flag%20desecration%20and%20misuse:Federal%20statute" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Federal_statute" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Federal_statute"></a><a id="XREF_24478_123" name="XREF_24478_123">The federal statute&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10235"></a> The problem with the Texas statute in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Texas v. Johnson</span> seemed to be the statute&#x2019;s proscription of flag burning that would &#x201c;seriously offend&#x201d; observers &#x2014; this reference to &#x201c;offensiveness&#x201d; made it clear that only flag burning intended to convey a particular message (disrespect) was proscribed by the statute. Therefore, immediately after the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Johnson</span> decision, the U.S. Congress tried to enact a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">federal</span> flag burning statute that would ban all or most flag burning without being content&#x2D;based and thus unconstitutional. This federal statute, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, punished anyone who &#x201c;knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States. &#x2026; &#x201d; However, even though the statute avoided any reference to conduct that would &#x201c;offend&#x201d; an observer, the Supreme Court, by a 5&#x2D;4 vote, found that this statute, too, was a violation of the First Amendment. <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">U.S. v. Eichman</span>, 496 U.S. 31&#x30; (199&#x30;). <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10236"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rationale&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10237"></a> The five&#x2D;justice majority in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Eichman</span> found that despite the more careful wording, this statute, like the one in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Johnson</span>, was content&#x2D;based. &#x201c;Although the [Act] contains no explicit content&#x2D;based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct, it is nevertheless clear that the government&#x2019;s asserted <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">interest</span> is ‘related to the suppression of free expression&#x2019; &#x2026; and concerned with the content of such expression.&#x201d; The majority noted that the government was asserting its interest in preserving the flag as a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">symbol for certain national ideals</span>; this goal was intimately related to the content of the burner&#x2019;s message (so that, for instance, a person&#x2019;s secret burning of the flag in his basement would not threaten this symbolic meaning of the flag). Since Congress was attempting to &#x201c;suppress &#x2026; expression out of concern for its likely communicative impact,&#x201d; the statute had to be strictly scrutinized. It failed that scrutiny. (Interestingly, Justice Scalia was part of the five&#x2D;member majority voting to strike down the statute, a surprise given his generally conservative views.) <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10240"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_41033_123" name="XREF_41033_123">Significance&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10241"></a> As a result of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Johnson</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Eichman</span>, there is probably no way for government (whether state or federal) to &#x201c;wipe out flag burning.&#x201d; Even if the statute uses the most content&#x2D;neutral language (e.g., &#x201c;No one may burn a flag under any circumstances&#x201d;), the statute will presumably be struck down so long as the Court believes that it was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">motivated</span> by a desire to preserve the symbolic value of the flag.

Its two biggest streets are Broadway and Main. After several recent parades and demonstrations that badly snarled traffic, Centerville&#x2019;s City Council enacted an ordinance that forbade all parades from taking place on either Broadway or Main. The ordinance did not forbid parades on the other, smaller streets in town. There is no evidence that the ordinance was motivated by hostility to particular types of parades, and the ban has been enforced even&#x2D;handedly as to all parades. Citizens Against Corruption, a group wishing to protest what it believed was corruption in the mayor&#x2019;s office, paraded in an organized way down Broadway, and its leaders were arrested. The city has asserted that its ban on parades is a valid &#x201c;time, place and manner&#x201d; regulation. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15504"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> What standard should the court use in evaluating the ordinance as applied here&#x3F; _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15505"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> Should the court uphold the ordinance, and convict the marchers, under the test you specified in (a)&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15509"></a>78. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="20414"></a>An ordinance in the town of Harmony provides that &#x201c;no demonstration or parade involving more than 2&#x30; persons shall take place on the town&#x2019;s streets, parks or other city&#x2D;owned property without the prior issuance of a permit.&#x201d; The permit is free, and is to be granted by the mayor&#x2019;s office, &#x201c;if the mayor concludes, acting in a reasonable manner, that the proposed activity would not be detrimental to the overall community, taking into account the &#x201c;time, place and manner&#x201d; of the activity.&#x201d; Firebrand, the head of a local group of anarchists, wished to conduct a demonstration in the park, at which he planned to urge his followers to immediately attempt a &#x201c;sit in&#x201d; of the mayor&#x2019;s office. The mayor, without knowing the precise purpose of the demonstration and knowing only that it was to be a demonstration against the local government, refused to issue the permit. In announcing the refusal, the mayor stated that &#x201c;there has been too much demonstration, and not enough cooperation, around here recently.&#x201d; Firebrand then brought suit for an injunction against continued application of the permit requirement, and for a declaratory judgment that the permit requirement as drafted was unconstitutional.

For any demonstration or parade involving more than 3&#x30; people, a permit was required, application for which must be made at least one hour prior to the close of business on the day before the proposed activity. Under the terms of the ordinance, the police commissioner was required to issue the permit, subject only to the rule that if in the commissioner&#x2019;s reasonable judgment, a breach of peace would be likely to occur which could not be controlled with the manpower available to the Lawton Police Department, the permit could be denied until such later date as proper police protection could be arranged (by borrowing from other police departments, if necessary). <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15523"></a>Rouser, a radical, applied late on Friday afternoon to make a speech on Saturday. Because past speeches by Rouser had led to skirmishes, and because the commissioner believed that under weekend police schedules only three officers would be available (a number which the Commissioner believed would not be sufficient if problems should occur), the Commissioner turned down the request for a permit, and suggested that Rouser wait until the following Saturday. A local Justice of the Peace Court was open Friday night, and the Justice would have had jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the permit requirement. However, Rouser did not seek an injunction. Instead, Rouser gave his speech anyway, and no violence occurred. Rouser was charged with violating the permit requirement. He is now defending on the grounds that he was wrongfully denied the permit, because there was not in fact a serious threat of a breach of the peace, and that even if there was one, the presence of three officers would have been sufficient.<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15524"></a>Assuming that the court agrees with Rouser&#x2019;s factual contentions about the danger of breach of the peace, should Rouser be acquitted&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15527"></a>81. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="15528"></a>The city of Blue Bell has enacted an ordinance providing as follows&#x3A; no &#x201c;canvasser or solicitor&#x201d; may ring the doorbell of a private home, or knock on the door of a private home, where her purpose is to distribute handbills or to solicit an order for goods, services or charitable contributions. The ban does not prevent a person from simply sticking advertising material under the door or into the mail slot, so long as there is no bell&#x2D;ringing or door&#x2D;knocking. The purpose of the ordinance is to avoid disturbing residents (including those who work nights and sleep days), and also to prevent crime (e.g., people who want to see into the residence to &#x201c;case the joint&#x201d; for a later burglary).<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15529"></a>Delrina, a Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness, was charged with violating the statute in that she rang doorbells so that she could personally hand inhabitants the literature requesting donations to the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness organization.

After complying with a city requirement calling for a permit before the making of a public address, Mohammed, a self&#x2D;proclaimed Islamic Fundamentalist, gave a speech in a park in Crooklyn. There were approximately 1&#x30;&#x30; Islamic followers in the audience, as well as a group of about 3&#x30; Orthodox Jews. The Jews carried signs opposing Mohammed. Mohammed then made various anti&#x2D;Semetic inflammatory statements, such as &#x201c;Jews are corrupt&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jews control the U.S. government.&#x201d; He also addressed the Jews in the audience, saying, &#x201c;You Jews in the audience today, you&#x2019;re not fit to kiss the dung&#x2D;stained shoes of my poorest follower.&#x201d; At no time did Mohammed urge his audience to attack any of the Jewish onlookers or to otherwise commit immediate illegal acts. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15534"></a>Some of the Jews in the audience began to shake their fists and yell back at Mohammed; five of them then began to move towards the podium with upraised fists. There were 15 police officers at the scene to prevent disturbances, most of them ringed around the podium. They immediately arrested Mohammed and charged him with violating an ordinance prohibiting anyone from inciting a riot or causing a breach of the peace.

The protesters remained at least 2&#x30; feet away from the front door of the clinic, and they did not block anyone&#x2019;s access to or from the clinic. All protesting took place on public property. A local ordinance forbids &#x201c;the making of any public statement or the showing of any sign where the speaker knows the statement or sign is likely to be offensive to the person to whom it is addressed.&#x201d; May a protester who has waved the sign and shouted the epithet described above be convicted of violating the statute&#x3F; _________________ <br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15544"></a>84. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="15545"></a>State U, a public university, recently added the following provision to its Student Code&#x3A; &#x201c;No student or faculty member shall address to any other student or faculty member any verbal slur, invective, insult or epithet based on the addressee&#x2019;s race, ethnicity, gender, handicap or sexual orientation.&#x201d; The penalty for a first offense is suspension, and for the second offense is expulsion.

The police appear to enforce the no&#x2D;solicitation rule uniformly, i.e., they stop everyone from soliciting, regardless of whether the solicitation is religiously&#x2D;oriented, regardless of whether it appears to be &#x201c;begging&#x201d; or on behalf of an organized charity, etc. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15555"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> Is the Station a &#x201c;public forum&#x201d; for purposes of First Amendment analysis&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15556"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> Was the police&#x2019;s treatment of Hussan constitutional&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="QuizAnsHead1" id="31263"></a>Answers<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15870"></a>77. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15871"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">The ban must be&#x3A; (1) content&#x2D;neutral; (2) </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"><a id="index_153796" name="index_153796"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3ENARROW%20TAILORING:Time,%20place%20and%20manner%20regulations%20as%20requiring" id="%3C$startrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring" name="%3C$startrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring"></a></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest; and (3) leave open alternative channels for communication of the information.</span> <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15872"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">No, probably.</span> The facts indicate to us that the ban is content&#x2D;neutral both in terms of the purposes for which it was enacted and the way in which it is applied. However, it seems not to be &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">narrowly tailored</span> to serve a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">significant</span> governmental interest.&#x201d; Since the proposed speech would take place in the most traditional of all public forums &#x2014; the streets &#x2014; mere convenience, such as avoiding traffic obstructions, probably does not qualify as a &#x201c;significant governmental interest.&#x201d; Also, there are more narrowly&#x2D;tailored restrictions that could be used, such as an advance permit requirement which would give the police time to detour traffic and thereby reduce disruption. Finally, the requirement that alternative channels be left open is strictly construed in a public&#x2D;forum context; the fact that there may be other public places (e.g., smaller streets) where the same expression is allowed will not generally be enough to qualify as an adequate alternative channel. <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"><a id="index_153815" name="index_153815"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW%20TAILORING:Time,%20place%20and%20manner%20regulations%20as%20requiring" id="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring" name="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring"></a></span><br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15875"></a>78. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15876"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes.</span> An advance permit requirement will be upheld if it is content&#x2D;neutral, adequately constrains administrative discretion, and is a reasonable means of insuring that public order is maintained. However, in order to avoid giving the official charged with granting or denying permit applications too much <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">discretion</span>, the grounds upon which a permit may be denied must be set forth <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">specifically</span> and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">narrowly</span> in the ordinance. Here, the standard given for granting or denying a permit &#x2014; that the proposed activities &#x201c;not be detrimental to the overall community&#x201d; &#x2014; gives the mayor virtually uncontrolled discretion, and acts as an invitation to him to behave in a content&#x2D;based way. This excessive discretion makes the statute overbroad and vague. Therefore, even though Firebrand&#x2019;s own proposed conduct might be capable of being prohibited by an appropriately&#x2D;drawn ordinance, the ordinance here must be struck down as invalid on its face.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15879"></a>79. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15880"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes.</span> If a permit that is required prior to the exercise of First Amendment rights is unconstitutional <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">on its face</span>, the speaker is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not required</span> to apply for a permit. He may decline to apply, then speak, and avoid conviction on the grounds of the permit requirement&#x2019;s unconstitutionality. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lovell v. Griffin</span>. Because a statute that is overbroad is facially invalid, this rule applies to overbreadth claims. Therefore, Firebrand may assert overbreadth even though he failed to ever apply for a permit.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15889"></a>8&#x30;. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15890"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> Where a permit requirement is not facially invalid (e.g., not unduly vague or overbroad), and the speaker&#x2019;s claim is merely that he has been wrongfully denied a permit, the speaker <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">must seek judicial relief</span> before speaking. That is, for an &#x201c;as applied&#x201d; as opposed to &#x201c;facial&#x201d; challenge to a permit requirement, one who ignores the denial of the permit loses the right to object to the permit scheme&#x2019;s unconstitutionality. There is an exception where the applicant shows that he could not have obtained prompt judicial review of the administrative denial of the permit; however, the facts here tell us that Rouser could have obtained judicial review prior to the time for the speech, if he had wanted to do so.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15894"></a>81. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15895"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> As with any &#x201c;time, place and manner&#x201d; restriction, the ordinance will be valid only if it is content&#x2D;neutral, is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"><a id="index_153830" name="index_153830"></a><a data-indexterm="NARROW%20TAILORING:Time,%20place%20and%20manner%20regulations%20as%20requiring" id="NARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring" name="NARROW_TAILORING_Time,_place_and_manner_regulations_as_requiring"></a></span>narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leaves open alternative channels for communicating the information. Here, probably the requirement of content&#x2D;neutrality is satisfied (unless there is evidence that, say, Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses were a special target of the ordinance). The government probably has a significant government interest in preventing homeowners from being disturbed at home when they do not want to be. However, it is doubtful that the ordinance is &#x201c;narrowly tailored,&#x201d; since there are less restrictive alternatives (e.g., permitting a homeowner to indicate on his door that he does not wish to be disturbed by solicitors) &#x2014; when the city makes a blanket assumption that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no</span> homeowner wishes to receive a solicitor, this is probably not a sufficiently narrowly tailored approach. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether alternative channels have been left open, since for many types of organizations, door&#x2D;to&#x2D;door and face&#x2D;to&#x2D;face is the only affordable means, given the large expense associated with, say, newspaper and TV advertising. Upon facts similar to these, the Court struck down a blanket ban. See <span style="font-style:Italic;">Watchtower Bible and Tract Soc. v. Stratton</span> (ban on solicitation without prior permit is unconstitutional).<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15901"></a>82. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15902"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">The &#x201c;fighting words&#x201d; doctrine.</span> <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15903"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, probably.</span> Among the classes of speech which are not protected by the First Amendment are &#x201c;fighting words,&#x201d; which the Court has defined as &#x201c;those which by their very utterance &#x2026; tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.&#x201d; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</span>. However, there are several exceptions and clarifications to the &#x201c;fighting words&#x201d; doctrine, which make it seldom applicable. One of those exceptions is that if the police have the physical ability to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">control the angry crowd</span> as a means of preventing threatened violence, they <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">must do so</span> in preference to arresting the speaker for using &#x201c;fighting words.&#x201d; <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Cox v. Louisiana</span>. Here, it seems probable that the 15 police officers could have either arrested or at least restrained those Jews who were moving forward towards the podium, and probably any other hostile Jew in the audience. At the very least, the police needed to make some effort to do this, rather than immediately arrest the speaker.<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="15906"></a>83. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15907"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No. </span>In general, government may not forbid speech merely because it would be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;offensive&#x201d;</span> to the listener. For example, language cannot be forbidden merely because it is profane. <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><a style="font-style:Italic;"></a></p><p class="_R1" id="15910"></a>84. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="15911"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> The problem is that the ban here is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content&#x2D;based</span>. That is, it proscribes only certain types of speech, based on the content or message of that speech. Thus insults based on race, ethnicity and three other attributes are banned, but insults based on other attributes are not (e.g., the addressee&#x2019;s politics, intelligence, short or tall stature, etc.). Even if the university interprets the ban so as to bar only &#x201c;fighting words,&#x201d; this will not be enough to save the statute, because <span style="font-style:Italic;">R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul</span> (striking down an anti&#x2D;cross&#x2D;burning statute) establishes that government may not ban some fighting words but not others, based on the words&#x2019; precise message. The best way for State U to solve the problem is to amend its code so as to ban &#x201c;all slurs, invectives, insults or epithets that would have the likely effect of either inducing the listener to respond with violence, or which would be likely to create in the listener an apprehension of imminent physical harm.&#x201d; Such a formulation would essentially ban all fighting words, plus all words that would constitute an assault; these two categories may clearly be constitutionally proscribed, as long as the proscription occurs in a content&#x2D;neutral way.  (Of course, this re&#x2D;write would fail to prohibit a lot of hate speech, so it would not be a perfect solution, but at least it would be content&#x2D;neutral.)<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="18784"></a>85.<br/></p><p class="_R2" id="18785"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> The Supreme Court has held that computer networks are more like newspapers than like broadcast TV, and that content&#x2D;based restrictions on what is placed on such networks must therefore be strictly scrutinized. See <span style="font-style:Italic;">Reno v. ACLU</span>. Applying strict scrutiny, the measure is clearly unconstitutional, since it&#x2019;s content&#x2D;based (only materials with an &#x201c;indecent&#x201d; message are proscribed), and it&#x2019;s not <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"><a id="index_154015" name="index_154015"></a><a data-indexterm="NARROW%20TAILORING:Content-based%20regulation%20of%20speech%20as%20requiring" id="NARROW_TAILORING_Content-based_regulation_of_speech_as_requiring" name="NARROW_TAILORING_Content-based_regulation_of_speech_as_requiring"></a></span>narrowly tailored towards the (admittedly &#x201c;compelling&#x201d;) objective of keeping indecent materials away from minors &#x2014; for instance, the state could give parents free filtering software that would block access to these materials by minors. See <span style="font-style:Italic;">Ashcroft v. ACLU.</span> Furthermore, the statute is overbroad&#x3A; it applies to viewing by adults (who have a right to see the photo), as well as to viewing by minors (who probably don&#x2019;t have a First Amendment right to see such a photo, though this is not completely clear). Since the rights of adults are being curtailed in a content&#x2D;based way, the statute will surely fail strict scrutiny. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Reno v. ACLU</span>.<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16103"></a>86. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="142282"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a) No.</span> The Supreme Court has held that airport terminals are not &#x201c;public forums,&#x201d; even though they are public places. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Int&#x2019;l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee</span>. Assuming that train stations are analyzed the same way as are airport terminals &#x2014; which seems virtually certain &#x2014; the terminal here falls into the category of &#x201c;non&#x2D;public forum.&#x201d; Non&#x2D;public forums are public facilities that are used for purposes that are not especially linked to expression; thus the terminal here is primarily linked to transportation, and has never historically been viewed as a center for expression.  <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="15923"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes.</span> A non&#x2D;public forum offers the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">least</span> constitutionally&#x2D;protected access for First Amendment expression. Government regulation of expression in a non&#x2D;public forum must merely be&#x3A; (1) <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">reasonable</span> in light of the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">purpose</span> served by the forum; and (2) <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">viewpoint neutral</span>. See <span style="font-style:Italic;">Krishna v. Lee</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>. The Court in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Krishna </span>held that these tests were met by a ban on funds solicitation in airport terminals; presumably the same analysis would apply to the fund solicitation in the train station here. The ban on face&#x2D;to&#x2D;face solicitation of money was found to be reasonable in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Krishna</span> because such solicitation might slow pedestrian traffic within the terminal, interfering with its transportation&#x2D;related function. (But a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">total ban</span> on <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">literature distribution</span> was found not to be even &#x201c;reasonable&#x201d; in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Krishna</span>.) <br/></p><p class="_QEnd" id="15494"></a><br/></p><p class="_L2Capt" id="10244" style="margin-top : 0.00pt;line-height : 0.00pt;color:#ffffff;"></a>DEFAMATION AND THE BANNING OF &#x201c;FALSE SPEECH&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_L2Capt" id="84742" style="margin-top : 12.00pt;"></a>VI.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_13023__VI__DEFAMATION_AND_INVASION_OF_PRIVACY123" name="XREF_13023__VI__DEFAMATION_AND_INVASION_OF_PRIVACY123"></a><a id="index_13913" name="index_13913"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EDEFAMATION:%14Generally%5BDEFAMATION:AAA%5D" id="%3C$startrange%3EDEFAMATION_AAA%5D" name="%3C$startrange%3EDEFAMATION_AAA%5D"></a><a id="index_15322" name="index_15322"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$nopage%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Defamation:%3CIndexItal%3ESee%20also%3CDefault%20Para%20Font%3E%20DEFAMATION" id="%3C$nopage%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_%3CIndexItal%3ESee_also%3CDefault_Para_Font%3E_DEFAMATION" name="%3C$nopage%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_%3CIndexItal%3ESee_also%3CDefault_Para_Font%3E_DEFAMATION"></a><a id="index_13914" name="index_13914"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Defamation" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Defamation" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Defamation"></a>DEFAMATION, INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;DISTRESS, AND THE BANNING OF &#x201c;FALSE SPEECH&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_L2Capt" id="84698" style="margin-top : 0.00pt;line-height : 0.00pt;color:#ffffff;"></a>DEFAMATION AND RELATED ISSUES<br/></p><p class="_L2Capt" id="51803" style="margin-top : 0.00pt;line-height : 0.00pt;color:#ffffff;"></a>DEFAMATION AND THE BANNING OF &#x201c;FALSE SPEECH&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="49834"></a>A.&#160;&#160;&#160; Regulation of defamatory and other false speech&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L4Text" id="49848"></a>Recall that there are certain pre&#x2D;defined categories of speech that receive no, or virtually no, First Amendment protection.

We concentrate here on one of those unprotected categories, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;defamation,&#x201d;</span> i.e., the making of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">false statements</span> that are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">damaging to reputation</span>.

For instance, in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Chaplinsky (supra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_13250_123">516</a>), the Court included libelous statements in the list of categories which are &#x201c;no essential part of any exposition of ideas,&#x201d; and as to which there is therefore no First Amendment protection. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10251"></a>C.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_12130_123" name="XREF_12130_123" style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times v.

This limiting process occurred initially in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</span>, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), where the Court concluded that the First Amendment requires that a defense for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;honest error&#x201d;</span> be allowed in the case of false statements made about <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public officials</span> relating to their <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">official conduct. <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10253"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10254"></a> Plaintiff in <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> was a public official one of whose duties was supervising the Montgomery, Alabama Police Department. He alleged that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Times</span> had libeled him by printing an advertisement that stated that the Montgomery police had attempted to terrorize Martin Luther King and his followers. (Plaintiff was not even named in the advertisement; but under Alabama libel law, criticism of the department of which he was in charge was deemed to reflect on his reputation.) <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10255"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Truth as affirmative defense&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10256"></a> The libel law of Alabama, like that of most states at the time, provided for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strict liability</span>. That is, a publisher could not avoid liability by showing that he reasonably believed his statement to be true, if it was in fact false. Furthermore, although &#x201c;truth&#x201d; was an available defense under Alabama law, it was an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">affirmative defense</span> as to which the defendant bore the burden of proof. Therefore, although the factual errors in the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Times</span> ad were minor (e.g., that Dr. King had been arrested seven times, rather than the actual four times), and even though there was no showing that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Times</span> ought to have known that the ad prepared by others contained falsehoods, the paper was nonetheless subjected to a &#x24;5&#x30;&#x30;,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; libel judgment. The net result was that familiar rules of libel gave Alabama&#x2019;s &#x201c;white establishment&#x201d; a formidable weapon with which to punish the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Times</span>, and any other proponents of civil rights.

The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish any &#x201c;false scandalous and malicious writings&#x201d; against the federal government with intent to bring it into &#x201c;contempt or disrepute.&#x201d; Although the Act expired before the Supreme Court determined its constitutionality, the view that the Act violated the First Amendment had &#x201c;carried the day in the court of history,&#x201d; according to the <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> Court. So, here, criticism of government public officials could not be curtailed, without violating the First Amendment. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10263"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_23393_123" name="XREF_23393_123">Formal rule&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10264"></a> The Court was not content merely to strike the libel judgment as a disguised ban on criticizing the government. Instead, it articulated a formal rule, so that future speakers would not have to worry about liability for libel in similar circumstances&#x3A; the First Amendment prohibits a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public official</span> from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">relating to his official conduct</span> unless he proves that the statement was made with <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;actual malice&#x201d;</span> &#x2014; that is, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;with knowledge that it was false</span> or with <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.&#x201d;</span> The case thus establishes a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;constitutional privilege for good faith critics of government officials.&#x201d;</span> Tribe, pp. 864&#x2D;65. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10265"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Knowing or reckless falsity&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10266"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> New York Times</span> requires the public official to prove that the defendant <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">knew</span> his statement was false, or <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">recklessly disregarded</span> whether it was true or not.

For instance, in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Time, Inc. v. Firestone</span>, 424 U.S. 448 (1976), <span style="font-style:Italic;">Time</span> incorrectly reported that one of the grounds for Ms. Firestone&#x2019;s divorce was adultery. The Court found that she was not a &#x201c;public figure,&#x201d; even though she had held some press conferences during the divorce trial, and even though the trial itself had been widely reported in the Miami newspapers. (Nor did Ms. Firestone&#x2019;s extensive activities before the trial as a prominent member of Palm Beach society make her a public figure.) <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10273"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_34582_123" name="XREF_34582_123">&#x201c;Involuntary&#x201d; class narrow&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10274"></a> Similarly, category (3), that of &#x201c;involuntary public figures,&#x201d; has also been narrowly construed by the Court; such involuntary figures will be relatively rare. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10275"></a>E.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_29248_123" name="XREF_29248_123">Privat</a><a id="index_13919" name="index_13919"></a><a data-indexterm="defamation:Damages%20for,%20types%20of" id="DEFAMATION_Damages_for,_types_of" name="DEFAMATION_Damages_for,_types_of"></a>e figu<a id="index_13920" name="index_13920"></a><a data-indexterm="defamation:“Private%20figures”%5BDEFAMATION:Private%5D" id="DEFAMATION_Private%5D" name="DEFAMATION_Private%5D"></a>res&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="10276"></a>The <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> standard does <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> apply to suits by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">private figures</span>. That is, where the plaintiff is neither a public official nor a public figure, there is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no constitutional requirement</span> that he prove that the defendant <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">knew his statement to be false or recklessly disregarded the truth. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</span> 418 U.S. 323 (1974). <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10277"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10278"></a> The plaintiff, Gertz, was a locally well&#x2D;known lawyer who represented the family of a youth who was killed by a policeman. Defendant, publisher of a John Birch Society magazine, falsely attacked Gertz as having helped &#x201c;frame&#x201d; the policeman and as being a communist. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10279"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Negligence standard permitted&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10280"></a> The Supreme Court held, 5&#x2D;4, that in libel actions brought by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">private figures</span>, the First Amendment <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">does not forbid use of a simple negligence standard</span>. The states are free to decide whether they wish to establish negligence, recklessness or knowing falsity as the standard (but they <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">may not impose strict liability). <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10281"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Reasoning&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10282"></a> The majority reasoned that private individuals are both more vulnerable, as well as more deserving of recovery for defamation, than public figures. They are more <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">vulnerable</span> because public figures generally have &#x201c;significantly greater access&#x201d; to the media, and can use that access to counteract false statements. They are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">deserving</span> of extensive protection against defamation, because public figures have generally &#x201c;voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehoods,&#x201d; unlike private persons. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10283"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Punitive damages not allowed&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10284"></a> The majority also held that, if a private figure shows only negligence on the part of the defendant, rather than recklessness or knowing falsity, he <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">may not recover presumed or punitive damages</span>. (&#x201c;Presumed&#x201d; damages are ones awarded where there is no proof of actual harm, but the jury believes that damage would ordinarily result from a defamatory communication like the one in issue.) The Court imposed this limitation because the state&#x2019;s interest in giving broader protection to private figures only justified awarding &#x201c;compensation for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">actual</span> injury.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10287"></a>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Who is private figure&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10288"></a> In holding that Gertz himself was a private figure, the Court implicitly took a narrow view of the term &#x201c;public figure.&#x201d; Gertz was a well&#x2D;known lawyer locally, and had agreed to take a case which he knew would attract substantial publicity. Nonetheless, Gertz had not achieved &#x201c;general fame or notoriety in the community&#x201d; (so that he was not public figure for all purposes); similarly, he was not a public figure for the limited purposes of this case, because he had played only a &#x201c;minimal role&#x201d; in it. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10289"></a>5.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissents&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10290"></a> The four dissenters differed significantly among themselves in reasoning. For instance, Justice Brennan continued to believe (as he had in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Rosenbloom</span> <span style="font-style:Italic;">v. Metromedia</span>, Inc., 4&#x30;3 U.S. 29) that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> standard should be applied to private&#x2D;person libel actions arising out of events of &#x201c;public or general interest.&#x201d; But Justice White argued the quite opposite position that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> majority should not even have stripped the states of their right to apply <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strict liability</span> in suits brought by private persons. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10291"></a>6.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_26861_123" name="XREF_26861_123">Proof</a><a id="index_13921" name="index_13921"></a><a data-indexterm="defamation:Falsity,%20burden%20of%20proving" id="DEFAMATION_Falsity,_burden_of_proving" name="DEFAMATION_Falsity,_burden_of_proving"></a> of falsity&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10292"></a> As noted, one aspect of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> is that the states may not impose strict liability, even in cases brought by private figures. This aspect of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> was broadened in the later case of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps,</span> 475 U.S. 767 (1986), where the Court held that the private figure suing a media defendant must bear the burden of proving not only &#x201c;fault,&#x201d; but also the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">falsity</span> of the defendant&#x2019;s statement. That is, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> has been held to replace the common&#x2D;law rule <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">presuming</span> falsity. (This holding applies only where the suit involves a matter of &#x201c;public interest&#x201d;; the presumption of falsity is probably constitutional where there is no matter of public concern, in light of <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_20975_123">556</a>.) <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10293"></a>F.&#160;&#160;&#160; Non&#x2D;med<a id="index_13922" name="index_13922"></a><a data-indexterm="defamation:Non-media%20defendants" id="DEFAMATION_Non-media_defendants" name="DEFAMATION_Non-media_defendants"></a>ia defendants&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="10294"></a> Both <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> involved <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">media</span> defendants, and in those cases the Court relied heavily on freedom&#x2D;of&#x2D;the&#x2D;press considerations, especially the need to prevent media self&#x2D;censorship. It is not clear whether the public&#x2D;figure standard of <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> and the private&#x2D;figure standard of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> also apply where the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">defendant</span> is a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">private person</span> or other <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">non&#x2D;media defendant. <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10295"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Possibility of different standard&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10296"></a> Thus it is possible that such defendants might be liable <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">without</span> a showing of reckless disregard or knowledge of falsity when they defame a public official or public figure. Similarly, they might even be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strictly liable</span> where they defame a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">private</span> figure. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10297"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Unlikely&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10298"></a> However, no Supreme Court case after <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> has made a constitutional distinction between media and non&#x2D;media defendants, and it&#x2019;s <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">unlikely</span> the Court will do so in the future. That&#x2019;s especially true now that the rise of the Internet has dramatically blurred the distinction between media and non&#x2D;media speakers. (For instance, if the Court were to hold non&#x2D;media defendants to a stricter standard in defamation cases, should an amateur blogger who blogs once a week be deemed a &#x201c;media&#x201d; speaker or a &#x201c;non&#x2D;media&#x201d; one&#x3F;) <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10301"></a>G.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_13924" name="index_13924"></a><a data-indexterm="defamation:Public%20interest,%20statements%20having%20no" id="DEFAMATION_Public_interest,_statements_having_no" name="DEFAMATION_Public_interest,_statements_having_no"></a><a id="XREF_20975_123" name="XREF_20975_123">Statements of no &#x201c;public interest&#x201d;&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="10302"></a> If the communication does <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not involve any matter of &#x201c;public interest,&#x201d;</span> special constitutional rules apply. These were laid down in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.,</span> 472 U.S. 749 (1985). <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10303"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10304"></a> D was a credit reporting agency which falsely reported to several subscribers that P, a small corporation, was insolvent. The issue in the case was whether presumed and punitive damages could be awarded without a showing of reckless disregard for the truth or actual knowledge of falsity. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10305"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Result&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10306"></a> Although no opinion commanded a majority of the Court, the divided Court affirmed an award of both types of damages. Three Justices thought that presumed and punitive damages could be awarded even without a showing of reckless disregard for the truth or knowledge of falsity if the statements did not involve any issue of &#x201c;public interest&#x201d;; two more Justices thought that <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz</span> was entirely wrongly decided (and thus that presumed and punitive damages should be allowed to all private plaintiffs, regardless of whether an issue of public interest was involved). <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10307"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Consequences&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10308"></a> Thus <span style="font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet</span> seems to put a majority of the Court behind two constitutional principles&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10309"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Presumed and punitive damages&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10310"></a> First, where a private plaintiff sues concerning statements that involve no issue of public interest, he can recover<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> presumed and punitive damages without </span>a showing that the defendant recklessly disregarded the truth or knew of the falsity of his statement. This is the actual result of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet. <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10311"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Strict liability&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10312"></a> Secondly, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet</span> probably means that where a private figure sues on a statement relating only to matters of private concern, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">he is not constitutionally required to show even ordinary negligence</span> in order to recover. (At least one member of the Court that decided <span style="font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet</span>, Justice White, concurring, stated that he believed this result to follow from <span style="font-style:Italic;">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet</span>.) <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10319"></a>H.&#160;&#160;&#160; Statem<a id="index_13925" name="index_13925"></a><a data-indexterm="defamation:Opinion" id="DEFAMATION_Opinion" name="DEFAMATION_Opinion"></a>ents of<a id="index_13926" name="index_13926"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Opinion,%20statements%20of" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Opinion,_statements_of" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Opinion,_statements_of"></a> opin<a id="index_13927" name="index_13927"></a><a data-indexterm="opinion:Statement%20of%20as%20defamation" id="OPINION_Statement_of_as_defamation" name="OPINION_Statement_of_as_defamation"></a>ion&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="10320"></a> The Supreme Court has refused to give special First Amendment protection for statements of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;opinion</span>.<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201d;</span> So some statements, even though they express opinions, may be the subject of defamation actions.

However, the majority opinion in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Milkovich</span> makes it clear that the Court&#x2019;s prior First Amendment rulings will ensure that statements of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">pure</span> opinion are not found to be defamatory. The Court observed that these prior cases require any libel plaintiff to prove&#x3A; (1) that the statement is &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">false</span>&#x201d;; and (2) that the statement can be reasonably interpreted as stating <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;actual facts&#x201d;</span> about an individual. A pure statement of opinion (e.g., &#x201c;In my opinion Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting the teachings of Marx and Lenin.&#x201d;) would not be actionable, because it&#x3A; (1) is not provably false; and (2) cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about the plaintiff. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="10339"></a>I.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_36209_123" name="XREF_36209_123">Intentio</a><a id="index_13943" name="index_13943"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Emotional%20distress,%20intentional%20infliction%20of" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Emotional_distress,_intentional_infliction_of" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Emotional_distress,_intentional_infliction_of"></a>nal infliction o<a id="index_13944" name="index_13944"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Intentional%20infliction%20of%20emotional%20distress" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress"></a>f emotional distress&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="10340"></a> The <span style="font-style:Italic;">New York Times</span> standard also applies to actions for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). </span>That is, a public figure or public official may recover against the publisher who causes such distress only if he can prove that the publication contained a false statement of fact published either with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether it was true or not.

But the plurality <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">rejected</span> this &#x201c;categorical&#x201d; assertion. True, certain categories of false statement could be restricted &#x2014; categories like defamatory statements, perjury, and fraudulent statements intended to extract some material benefit from another (e.g., fraudulent commercial speech). But outside of these few pre&#x2D;defined categories where there was inevitably some special harm caused by the falsehood, the Court had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">never held that false statements are without constitutional protection</span>, and the plurality wasn&#x2019;t willing to do so now.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="50245"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Strict scrutiny applied&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="50185"></a> In fact, the plurality held, even though the Act barred only false statements, the Act needed to be subjected to &#x201c;the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">most exacting scrutiny.&#x201d; </span>The plurality conceded that the government&#x2019;s interest in ensuring that the public&#x2019;s general perception of military awards not be diluted by false claims was a compelling interest. But no matter how compelling the government&#x2019;s interest, the statute could survive only if the particular restriction imposed was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;actually necessary&#x201d; </span>to achieve that interest. <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="50270"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Alternatives available&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="50277"></a>The plurality concluded that the government had not made this showing of &#x201c;actual necessity.&#x201d; In particular, the government had not shown why <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;counterspeech&#x201d;</span> would not suffice. For instance, in the case of false claims concerning the Congressional Medal of Honor (the most&#x2D;heavily&#x2D;punished type of violation under the Act, and the one with which Alvarez had been charged), the government could combat the lying problem by creating an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">online database </span>that would list Medal of Honor winners, making it &#x201c;easy to verify and expose false claims.&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="49962"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Two additional votes&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="50363"></a> Justice Breyer (joined by Kagan) agreed with the plurality that the Act was unconstitutional, making 6 votes for that proposition. But Breyer applied <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;intermediate scrutiny&#x201d;</span> rather than the plurality&#x2019;s strict scrutiny. Even under this easier&#x2D;to&#x2D;satisfy standard, however, the statute could not survive, because the government had not shown that a &#x201c;more finely tailored statute&#x201d; could not adequately address the harms. For instance, the statute might be rewritten to require that the false statement &#x201c;caused specific harm&#x201d; or was &#x201c;material.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="50349"></a>e.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="50398"></a>Three Justices dissented, contending that the statute was constitutional. Justice Alito (joined by Scalia and Thomas) pointed out that the statute was narrowly drafted, and reached only &#x201c;knowingly false statements about <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">hard facts directly within a speaker&#x2019;s personal knowledge.&#x201d; </span>Also, he said, the statute was &#x201c;strictly<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> viewpoint neutral</span>&#x201d; &#x2014; it reached <span style="font-style:Italic;">all</span> false statements about medals, whether the statements disparaged or commended the military or the system of military honors. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="50688"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Harmful&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="50702"></a> On the other hand, Alito said, the lies forbidden by the statute &#x201c;inflict substantial harm,&#x201d; because they &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">debase the distinctive honor</span>&#x201d; of military awards, by making them <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">seem more common </span>than they really are.

The state&#x2019;s interest was only the weak one of &#x201c;protect[ing] the individual&#x2019;s mind from the effects of obscenity.&#x201d; The individual&#x2019;s interest was directly contrary, and much stronger&#x3A; that of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not having his thoughts controlled</span>. &#x201c;If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10445"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Two interests&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10446"></a> Thus the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Stanley</span> rule relied on two distinct interests held by individuals&#x3A; the First Amendment interest in having free access to ideas, and a distinct <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">privacy</span> interest in not having what one does in one&#x2019;s own home made the subject of government scrutiny. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="10453"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Possess<a id="index_13958" name="index_13958"></a><a data-indexterm="obscenity:Child%20pornography,%20possession%20of" id="OBSCENITY_Child_pornography,_possession_of" name="OBSCENITY_Child_pornography,_possession_of"></a>ion of child pornography&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="10454"></a> There is one important exception to <span style="font-style:Italic;">Stanley&#x2019;s</span> rule that private possession of obscene material by an adult may not be made criminal&#x3A; the states may criminalize even private possession of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">child pornography</span>.

The statute gave an exemption for a depiction that has &#x201c;serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical or artistic value.&#x201d; The legislative history of the statute showed that it was designed to eliminate the market for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;crush videos,&#x201d;</span> videos depicting the intentional torture and killing of small animals, often by showing women slowly crushing the animals to death with their bare feet or high&#x2D;heeled shoes. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="41501"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; The defendant&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="41502"></a>But in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Stevens</span>, D was convicted not for selling a crush video, but for selling videos of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">dogfights</span> involving pitbulls.

There might well be portrayals of animal cruelty that government <span style="font-style:Italic;">could</span> constitutionally ban in order to avoid harm to animals. But the statute here criminalized a far <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">greater range of content </span>than could be prohibited consistently with the First Amendment. For instance, the statute covered depictions in which a living animal was &#x201c;wounded or killed,&#x201d; even if no cruelty was involved. It was true that the statute applied only where the conduct depicted was against the law of the state where the video was made, possessed, or sold. But the statute by its terms would apply to, say, the depiction of hunting done by a particular method that was legal in the place where it happened, but illegal in the place where the resulting video was possessed or sold. Therefore,<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> a substantial number of the possible applications of the statute </span>were unconstitutional.

But this interest amounted to saying that consumers would be best protected <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">if kept in ignorance</span>.

(The link between promotional advertising and inequitable rates was, by contrast, too speculative to satisfy the &#x201c;direct link&#x201d; requirement.) <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="10859"></a>iv.&#160;&#160;&#160; Least&#x2D;restrictive alternative&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="10860"></a> With respect to the ban as a way of promoting energy conservation, part (iv) was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not satisfied</span>; the ban was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">more extensive than needed</span> to further that interest.

He thought that the majority&#x2019;s four&#x2D;part test did not give the government enough power to regulate commercial speech, and that the test gave commercial speech falling within the First Amendment protection that was &#x201c;virtually indistinguishable&#x201d; from that given to non&#x2D;commercial speech. Rehnquist believed that the regulation here was more an economic regulation than a restraint on &#x201c;free speech.&#x201d; Therefore, he would have given it &#x201c;virtually complete deference,&#x201d; in contrast to what he viewed as the majority&#x2019;s resurrection of the discredited doctrine of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lochner v.

This &#x201c;directly advance&#x201d; requirement means that the regulation must &#x201c;significantly,&#x201d; not just slightly, advance the state&#x2019;s goal. Here, there is no evidence that prohibiting price advertising <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">significantly</span> curtails alcohol consumption. Second, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson Gas </span>also requires that a regulation of commercial speech be <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;no more extensive than necessary.&#x201d;</span> The ban fails this requirement, too,<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> </span>since the state could have limited alcohol consumption by less restrictive means, such as increased taxation, limits on per capita purchases, or educational campaigns.<a id="Ch14__FNB_11" name="Ch14__FNB_11"></a><a  href="#Ch14__FNH_11"><sup>11</sup></a> <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"><a id="XREF_44_Liquormart_v__Rhode_Island_cross-ref123" name="XREF_44_Liquormart_v__Rhode_Island_cross-ref123" style="font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;">44 Liquormart v.

Since Liberty was a small town, most people knew who Joe was, but they didn&#x2019;t know much about his personal life, and he had never been involved in politics. One day, the local newspaper, the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Liberty Post</span>, reported that Joe had shot Tim, a shopper in the store, based on Joe&#x2019;s mistaken belief that Tim was attempting to rob the store. In fact, Tim was shot in Joe&#x2019;s store, but by Pete, Joe&#x2019;s employee, who Joe then immediately fired. (Tim was not in fact trying to shoplift, and Pete simply made a bad mistake.) Joe has brought a libel action against the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span>. The state&#x2019;s policy is to allow a libel recovery whenever such a recovery would be allowed at common law and would not be forbidden by the U.S. Constitution. At the end of the case, the judge charged the jury that Joe could recover against the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span> if the jury found that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span> had been negligent, but not if it found that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span> had made a non&#x2D;negligent error as to the underlying facts.

While they were standing inside the foyer of his house making the arrest, they saw copies of two unusual publications. One was <span style="font-style:Italic;">Kiddie World</span>, which contained pictures of nude adolescents; the adolescents were suggestively posed, but were not engaged in real or simulated sexual activities. The second publication was <span style="font-style:Italic;">Barnyard Illustrated</span>, which consisted exclusively of pictures of men and women having real or simulated sex with a variety of barnyard animals, including sheep and goats. A state ordinance forbids the sale or possession of &#x201c;any pictorial material containing sexually explicit photographs that are obscene under prevailing constitutional standards.&#x201d; Assume that Emilio can be shown to have known the contents of both of these magazines. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15609"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> Can Emilio be convicted for violating the ordinance as to <span style="font-style:Italic;">Kiddie World</span>&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15610"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> Can Emilio be convicted for violating the ordinance as to <span style="font-style:Italic;">Barnyard Illustrated</span>&#x3F; _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15614"></a>89. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="15615"></a>Congress has concluded that the nicotine used in cigarettes is &#x201c;highly addictive.&#x201d; Congress has also concluded that cigarette advertising causes many minors (who under federal and state laws can&#x2019;t legally buy the product) to take up smoking. Therefore, Congress has now banned all print advertising for cigarettes. Together with a prior ban on broadcast advertising for cigarettes, this means that billboards and handbills are now the only allowable means of advertising cigarettes. The cigarette industry asserts that this near total ban violates its right of free expression. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15616"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> What is the test that the Court will use in evaluating the constitutionality of the ban&#x3F; _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15617"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> Is the statute constitutional&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="QuizAnsHead1" id="16001"></a>Answers<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16007"></a>87. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="16008"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, probably.</span> The first question is whether Joe is a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;public figure.&#x201d;</span> If he is a public figure, he may not be permitted to recover unless he shows &#x201c;actual malice&#x201d; on the part of the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span>, i.e., that either the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span> had knowledge that its statement about who did the shooting was false, or that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span> acted with &#x201c;reckless disregard&#x201d; of whether the statement was false or not. So if Joe is a public figure, then the judge&#x2019;s instruction is wrong. Joe might be held to be an &#x201c;involuntary public figure&#x201d; because of his involvement in this matter of obvious public interest; however, since he is not a criminal defendant, and since the Court has construed the &#x201c;involuntary public figure&#x201d; category narrowly, probably Joe does not fall into this category. Joe is certainly not a generally famous person (even locally), nor one who has voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy, so he probably doesn&#x2019;t fit into either of the other public figure categories recognized by the Court. <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="16009" style="text-indent : 10.80pt;"></a>If Joe is in fact a &#x201c;private figure,&#x201d; then the judge&#x2019;s charge is correct. Under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gertz v. Robert Welch, </span>where P is neither a public official nor a public figure, there is no constitutional requirement that he prove that the defendant knew his statement to be false or recklessly disregarded the truth. (On the other hand, the state would not be permitted to grant Joe a recovery based on strict liability; the First Amendment requires that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Post</span> be proven to be at least negligent, even in a suit brought by a private figure.)  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16015"></a>88.<br/></p><p class="_R2" id="16016"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes.</span> On these facts, Kiddie World is probably not, strictly speaking, &#x201c;obscene&#x201d; under Supreme Court definitions. The reason is that mere nudity, without any attempt to portray sexual activity, is not considered &#x201c;obscene.&#x201d; However, the state&#x2019;s interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children is so strong that states may prohibit the sale, and even the private possession, of sexually explicit nude pictures of children, even though these are not strictly speaking &#x201c;obscene.&#x201d; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Osborne v. Ohio</span>.  <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="16017"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> The material here is almost certainly &#x201c;obscene.&#x201d; Under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Miller v. California</span>, material is obscene if it depicts &#x201c;patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sex acts, normal or perverted. &#x2026; &#x201d; It must be the case that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest, and that the work taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. These tests all seem to be satisfied by the material here. However, the mere <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">private possession</span> of obscene material by an adult may not be made criminal. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Stanley v. Georgia</span>. Therefore, even though the state might be able to punish the person who sold the magazine to Emilio, it may not punish Emilio for knowingly possessing the material in his house. (As noted in part (a), possession of material showing sexually explicit photos of children does not come within the purview of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Stanley</span>.)  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="18792"></a>89. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="82306"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">In theory, the four&#x2D;part test of </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson Gas v. Public Service Comm.</span>, as modified by later cases. First, the Court will determine whether the commercial speech is protected at all by the First Amendment; commercial speech receives at least partial protection so long as it is not &#x201c;misleading&#x201d; and does not propose unlawful activity. Next, the Court asks whether the governmental interest in support of the regulation is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;substantial</span>.<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201d;</span> Third, the Court decides whether the regulation <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;directly advances&#x201d;</span> the governmental interest being sought. Finally, the Court asks whether the restriction is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;not more extensive than is necessary&#x201d;</span> to serve the governmental objective.  (But some post&#x2D;<span style="font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson</span> cases<span style="font-style:Italic;"> </span>suggest that when a ban on advertising is premised on the idea that less advertising of a harmful product will lead to less consumption, the Court may apply <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strict scrutiny</span>, not the mid&#x2D;level standard of <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson Gas</span>. So the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson Gas</span> test might not be applied here.)<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="18796"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Unclear, but the statute would probably be struck down.</span> Even if the not&#x2D;so&#x2D;hard&#x2D;to&#x2D;satisfy <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson Gas</span> test were applied, the restriction would probably not survive. General cigarette advertising is not &#x201c;misleading&#x201d; and does not propose unlawful activity (since Congress has not outlawed the sale of cigarettes), so the speech gets some First Amendment protection. It&#x2019;s true that the government&#x2019;s interest in preventing additional people (especially minors) from becoming &#x201c;addicted&#x201d; certainly seems to be &#x201c;substantial.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s also true that a ban on all print advertising certainly seems to &#x201c;directly advance&#x201d; the objective of preventing the creation of new smokers, given the power of advertising. However, <span style="font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">44 Liquormart</span> says that the anti&#x2D;consumption impact of the regulation must be &#x201c;significant,&#x201d; and it&#x2019;s not clear that the impact here would qualify. Furthermore, it&#x2019;s not clear whether the ban is &#x201c;not more extensive than is necessary&#x201d; to serve this interest, since there are some less&#x2D;restrictive methods (e.g., a broader anti&#x2D;smoking campaign, or higher taxes) that haven&#x2019;t been tried yet.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="18797"></a>It may be that the fact that the users that Congress is principally targeting are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">minors</span>, who under state and federal law can&#x2019;t be legal purchasers of the product, may lead the Court to give more deference to the restriction here than it did to the no&#x2D;liquor&#x2D;price&#x2D;ads restriction struck down in<span style="font-style:Italic;"> 44 Liquormart. </span>But in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, </span>the Court struck down several state regulations against smokeless tobacco advertising where the regulations were designed to protect minors (e.g., a ban on outdoor advertising, and a rule that advertising within a retail store had to be at least five feet above the floor). In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Lorillard</span>, the Court said that regardless of the importance of protecting minors, <span style="font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;</span>the state may not regulate advertising in a way that interferes materially with the legitimate rights of the tobacco industry, and its <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">adult customers</span>, to exchange truthful information.&#x201d; So protection of minors probably won&#x2019;t be enough to save the statute here from being found to flunk the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Central Hudson Gas</span> requirements that the government regulation (1) <span style="font-style:Italic;">significantly</span> reduce the use of the harmful substance; and (2) be &#x201c;<span style="font-style:Italic;">not more extensive than necessary</span>&#x201d; to serve the state interest. <br/></p><p class="_QEnd" id="15591"></a><br/></p><p class="_L2Capt" id="37587"></a>IX.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_41322__IX__REGULATION_IN_THE_CONTEXT_OF_POLITICAL_CAMPAIGNS%0D123" name="XREF_41322__IX__REGULATION_IN_THE_CONTEXT_OF_POLITICAL_CAMPAIGNS%0D123">REGULATION IN THE CONTEXT OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS<br/></a></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="37588"></a>A.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_25935_%0D123" name="XREF_25935_%0D123"></a><span style="font-size : 14.50pt;color:#ffffff;"><a id="index_95337" name="index_95337"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$nopage%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Campaign%20spending%20as:%3CIndexItal%3ESee%20%3CDefault%20Para%20Font%3E%22Political%20campaign%20spending%22%20under%20this%20main%20heading" id="%3C$nopage%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_%3CIndexItal%3ESee_%3CDefault_Para_Font%3E%22Political_campaign_spending%22_under_this_main_heading" name="%3C$nopage%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_%3CIndexItal%3ESee_%3CDefault_Para_Font%3E%22Political_campaign_spending%22_under_this_main_heading"></a></span>Money in political campaigns, generally&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L4Text" id="37589"></a>In the modern political campaign, speech and the expenditure of money seem inevitably to go hand in hand.

The interest in preventing actual or apparent corruption did not apply to this situation, since obviously a candidate would not bribe himself. And the interest in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">equalizing the resources</span> of competing candidates was not well served by the spending limit, since a candidate who spent less of his own money than his opponent could nonetheless outspend the latter by raising more money from outside sources. Therefore, no state interest was sufficient to outweigh the candidate&#x2019;s own &#x201c;First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly advocate his own election. &#x2026;&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="39491"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Still valid&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="39492"></a> This principle that the amount a candidate may spend from his own resources may not be capped remains intact &#x2014; and indeed has been expanded &#x2014; in the Roberts court.

Candidates have a First Amendment right to spend as much as they wish to promote their own political views, and the governmental interest in curbing the skyrocketing costs of political campaigns is not sufficient to outweigh that right, the Court held. (But Congress may create a scheme for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">publicly funding</span> elections, in which case the candidate <span style="font-style:Italic;">may</span> be required to choose between respecting an aggregate spending limit and losing the public subsidy.)<br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="37626"></a>7.&#160;&#160;&#160; Other opinions&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="37627"></a> Only three Justices joined the Court&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span> opinion in its entirety.

In his view, contributions, no less than expenditures, were ways of communicating. Contributions were simply a way of &#x201c;pooling&#x201d; money, and were thus associational activities comparable to, say, volunteer work; therefore, freedom of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">association</span> as well as freedom of speech required that these not be restricted unless there was no less&#x2D;restrictive satisfactory alternative. In Burger&#x2019;s view, anti&#x2D;bribery laws and disclosure requirements could solve the corruption problems inherent in large contributions just as they could in the expenditure context. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="37631"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_RTF32383931373a202e4d344361123" name="XREF_RTF32383931373a202e4d344361123">White&#x2019;s concurrence&#x3A; <br/></a></p><p class="_L8Text" id="37632"></a> Justice White, like Justice Burger, saw no principled distinction between expenditures and contributions.

He disagreed with the plurality&#x2019;s equation of money with speech. Also, he would have deferred much more completely to Congress&#x2019; superior knowledge of what motivates politicians, and to its conclusion that expenditure limits on both private citizens and candidates are needed to accomplish the goals of preventing bribery and corruption and equalizing &#x201c;access to the political area.&#x201d; <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"><br/></span></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="37634"></a>8.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_RTF38313935373a202e4c364361123" name="XREF_RTF38313935373a202e4c364361123"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span> remains valid (<span style="font-style:Italic;">Randall v.

This amendment said that when a candidate for the House of Representatives spent more than &#x24;35&#x30;,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; of his own funds, the candidate&#x2019;s <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">adversary</span> could receive individual contributions at <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">three times the usual rate </span>(i.e., subject to a per&#x2D;donor limit of &#x24;6,9&#x30;&#x30; rather than the usual &#x24;2,3&#x30;&#x30;). The idea was to &#x201c;even the playing field,&#x201d; so that the millionaire candidate wouldn&#x2019;t have an unfair advantage from his ability to self&#x2D;fund without limit.

Candidates could agree to limit their own spending to &#x24;5&#x30;&#x30;, and thereby receive public funds. The key innovation was that during the course of the campaign, if a candidate who did not take the public option then spent more than a certain amount of her own money (or raised more than a certain amount from contributors), the publicly&#x2D;funded candidate would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">get additional equalizing or matching funds. </span>In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Arizona Free Enterprise Club&#x2019;s Freedom Club PAC v.

Since &#x201c;each personal dollar spent by the privately financed candidate results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent,&#x201d; the structure &#x201c;forces the privately financed candidate to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">‘shoulder a special and potentially significant burden&#x2019; </span>when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his candidacy.&#x201d; <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"><br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="47228"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="47235"></a>The four dissenters, in an opinion by Justice Kagan, believed that the matching&#x2D;funds mechanism here was perfectly proper.

During this cycle, federal campaign restrictions prohibited an individual from contributing more than &#x24;48,6&#x30;&#x30; to all federal candidates, and from giving more than &#x24;74,6&#x30;&#x30; to all non&#x2D;candidate&#x2D;controlled political committees. These <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;aggregate&#x201d;</span> restrictions were on top of &#x201c;base&#x201d; restrictions limiting how much an individual could contribute to any <span style="font-style:Italic;">one</span> candidate (&#x24;5,2&#x30;&#x30;, counting both the primary and general elections) or to any one political committee (&#x24;5,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30;). <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="85519"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Plaintiffs&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="89076"></a> The two plaintiffs &#x2014; a donor and a political party &#x2014; challenged these aggregate limits as a violation of their First Amendment rights.<br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="85521"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Struck down by 5&#x2D;4 vote&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="85522"></a> The Supreme Court, in a 5&#x2D;4 victory for the conservative bloc of the Court, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">struck down the aggregate limits as violations on the free speech rights of contributors. </span>The main opinion was a plurality opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Alito); the fifth vote came from Justice Thomas, who concurred in the result. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="85523"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Relation between base and aggregate limits&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="85524"></a>Roberts conceded that the Court had long held that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">base</span> limits &#x2014; the maximum contribution by one donor to one candidate &#x2014; serve the permissible objective of combating corruption and the appearance of it.

The question was whether the <span style="font-style:Italic;">aggregate</span> limits, too, could be found to serve the anti&#x2D;corruption objective. The federal government, defending the aggregate limits, argued that the answer was yes; for one thing, the government said, the aggregate limits would make it harder for donors and political parties to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">circumvent the base limits.<br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="85525"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Only corruption&#x2D;prevention an allowable objective&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="85526"></a>But Roberts rejected this &#x201c;circumvention&#x201d; defense of the aggregate limits.

But Roberts concluded that the aggregate limits &#x201c;do <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">little, if anything, to address [the circumvention] concern</span>, while <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">seriously restricting participation</span> in the democratic process.&#x201d; That was enough to make the limits invalid under the First Amendment.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="85537"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Thomas adds fifth vote&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="85538"></a>The fifth vote to uphold the aggregate limits came from Justice Thomas, who concurred in the judgment.

Political contributions whose amounts were regulated by the FECA (the act upheld in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span>) were and are known as<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> &#x201c;hard money&#x201d;</span> donations. But the FECA as interpreted by the Federal Election Commission treated certain donations and expenditures as not falling within this regulated, hard&#x2D;money classification; these unregulated sums are what is known as soft money. For instance, donors could contribute<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> unlimited soft&#x2D;money sums to the Democratic and Republican national parties</span> (or special committees run by those parties), and the parties could then <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">re&#x2D;spend the money </span>however they wanted as long as the funds were not used to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a particular candidate. Such large soft&#x2D;money donations could be given by wealthy individuals, corporations, labor unions, and anyone else, as long as the funds were used in this no&#x2D;advocacy&#x2D;of&#x2D;election&#x2D;or&#x2D;defeat&#x2D;of&#x2D;a&#x2D;specific&#x2D;candidate manner.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="41898"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Get&#x2D;out&#x2D;the&#x2D;vote and other uses of soft money&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="41899"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> S</span>o, for instance, the national political parties could raise large sums from wealthy donors, then spend those sums on activities like <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">get&#x2D;out&#x2D;the&#x2D;vote drives </span>(directed at voters expected to vote for the party putting on the drive), and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">generic party advertising</span> (e.g., &#x201c;Vote for the Democratic ticket this November 2nd.&#x201d;) <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="41900"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Issue ads&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="41901"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> T</span>he second practice that was upsetting Congress was the use of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">special&#x2D;issue broadcast ads</span> by groups like <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">corporations </span>and<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> labor unions</span>. If a corporation or union wanted to buy an ad expressly advocating the election or defeat of a particular candidate, that ad had to be paid for with hard (and thus tightly&#x2D;regulated) dollars, and lots of information about the sponsor of the ad had to be disclosed. But if the sponsor avoided the &#x201c;magic words&#x201d; &#x2014; i.e., words expressly advocating a particular candidate&#x2019;s election or defeat &#x2014; then the ad could be funded by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">unlimited sums furnished by the corporation or union</span>, and with no disclosure of the sponsors&#x2019; identity.  These ads are generically known as <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;issue ads&#x201d;</span> (and ones attacking rather than supporting a particular candidate are known as <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;attack ads&#x201d;</span>).Thus a Republican&#x2D;leaning advocacy group might purchase ads attacking Democratic Congressman Joe Smith&#x2019;s voting record on Social Security, and then conclude, &#x201c;Call Joe Smith and tell him to stop weakening Social Security.&#x201d; These attack ads were in fact often <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">more effective</span> than direct &#x201c;vote for [or against] Jane Doe&#x201d; ads.<br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="41902"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Congress attacks the twin evils&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="41903"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> </span>So by enacting the BCRA, Congress tried to curb the abuses associated with both unregulated soft money and with issue ads purchased by that unregulated money. In doing so, Congress believed that it was acting to reduce not only corruption but the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">appearance</span> of corruption, stemming from wealthy donors&#x2019; apparent attempt to purchase access to office holders.  The heart of the BCRA consisted of Titles I and II.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="41904"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Title I on soft money&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="41905"></a><span style="font-size : 12.00pt;"> </span>Title I of the BCRA was Congress&#x2019; attempt to plug the soft&#x2D;money loophole.

Educators must of course be given the right to determine what is to be taught in the public schools.

In <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Board of Education v.

The books were all on a list published by a conservative parents&#x2019; group and were labelled by the board as &#x201c;anti&#x2D;American, anti&#x2D;Christian, anti&#x2D;Semitic, and just plain filthy.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="10946"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="10947"></a> Because of the procedural posture, the Supreme Court did not directly decide whether the school board had violated the Constitution in ordering the removal of the books. The plurality did, however, articulate what it saw as the appropriate constitutional standard&#x3A; a school board has wide authority in determining what books to remove from a library, but it may not remove books for the purpose of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">denying access to ideas for political or partisan reasons</span>. As an extreme example, the plurality noted that a Democratic school board could not, motivated by party affiliation, order the removal of all books written by Republicans. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="10956"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Curriculum and textbooks&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="10957"></a> It is hard to know what standard the Court will apply to the issue of school authorities&#x2019; discretion to select the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">curriculum</span> and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">required textbooks</span>. Although, as noted, the Court will probably recognize greater discretion here than in the library&#x2D;book&#x2D;removal situation of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Pico</span>, it is not clear that this discretion will be much broader. Something like <span style="font-style:Italic;">Pico</span>&#x2019;s ban on &#x201c;narrow partisan or political motives&#x201d; will probably be applied in this situation as well. For instance, it is doubtful that a majority of the Court would uphold a school board&#x2019;s rule that no teacher may express in class the opinion that the war in Vietnam was morally and legally wrong. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="10958"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Teacher&#x2019;s own expression of views&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="10959"></a> At the same time, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">individual teachers</span> may probably take actions which a school board would not be permitted to take on a system&#x2D;wide basis.

The principal demanded that Frederick take down the banner, because she thought it encouraged illegal drug use in violation of school policy; she also suspended him from school.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="38725"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Action upheld&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="38726"></a>The Court held that the confiscation of the banner and suspension of Frederick <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">did not violate</span> his First Amendment rights.

One concern which many states have had is that people or organizations might <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">stir up litigation</span> in which they have no direct pecuniary interest, and might then exercise control over the handling of the law suit, control which should normally be solely in the hands of the lawyer and client. Most states would, for instance, prohibit the creation of a for&#x2D;profit corporation whose purpose is to advertise to personal&#x2D;injury victims the availability of contingent&#x2D;fee representation, and to receive a commission, or &#x201c;forwarding fee&#x201d; from the lawyer to whom the corporation assigns a case; even under the modern Court&#x2019;s relaxed view of lawyer advertising, such prohibitions would almost certainly be upheld. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11008"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rights and political expression&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11009"></a> However, these valid state interests may sometimes conflict with the interests of an organization in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">furthering political goals</span> or obtaining economic benefits for its members, by notifying individuals of their legal rights, referring them to lawyers, or paying their legal bills. In general, where a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">lay organization</span> (i.e., one not composed solely of lawyers) is able to make a respectable claim that it is engaged in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">associational activities</span> when it gives such advice, referrals or funding, these freedom&#x2D;of&#x2D;association rights will <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">prevail</span> over the state interest in regulating the attorney&#x2D;client relationship. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11010"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_15018_123" name="XREF_15018_123" style="font-style:Italic;">NAACP v.

The Virginia courts held that these activities violated both the anti&#x2D;control and anti&#x2D;compensation rules. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11014"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Activities held protected&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11015"></a> But the Supreme Court held that the NAACP&#x2019;s activities were &#x201c;modes of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">expression</span> and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">association</span> protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments,&#x201d; and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">could not be prohibited</span> under the state&#x2019;s power to regulate the legal profession. The Court reasoned that the litigation promoted by the NAACP was not a &#x201c;technique of resolving private differences,&#x201d; but was rather a means for achieving equal treatment for blacks, and was thus a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;form of political expression.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11028"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Primus&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11029"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> Button</span> has been extended, to allow an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">individual lawyer</span> to solicit clients as part of her <span style="font-style:Italic;">pro bono</span> work on behalf of the ACLU.

In these two contexts &#x2014; government as speaker, and government as funder of speech &#x2014; government seems to have at least somewhat greater ability to prefer one viewpoint over another than it does when it merely regulates.

One of these was a Ten Commandments monument donated in 1971. Members of the Summum religion then asked the city to accept and display in the same park a monument showing the &#x201c;Seven Aphorisms,&#x201d; which Summum adherents believe were brought down from Mt.

Twenty&#x2D;two states, including Illinois, enacted such statutes, making them &#x201c;agency shop&#x201d; states. The rest passed &#x201c;right to work&#x201d; statutes, which prohibited deduction of agency fees from non&#x2D;members without their consent.

Under the Illinois agency&#x2D;shop statute, the union was allowed to charge Janus an &#x201c;agency fee&#x201d; (by having the fee withheld from his wages) covering the union&#x2019;s direct costs of fulfilling its collective&#x2D;bargaining obligation; the union set these at about 78% of full union dues. Janus asserted in the litigation that in view of Illinois&#x2019; &#x201c;fiscal crisis,&#x201d; he opposed certain positions the union had been taking in collective bargaining. Therefore, he said, the non&#x2D;member agency fees charged to him were <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;coerced political speech&#x201d; </span>in violation of his First Amendment rights. This was exactly the argument that had been foreclosed by the decision in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Abood</span>.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="124724"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Majority agrees with plaintiff&#x2019;s argument&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="124726"></a> By a 5&#x2D;4 vote, the Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">agreed with plaintiff Janus&#x2019; argument. </span>Justice Alito, joined by the other conservative&#x2D;leaning Justices (Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas and Gorsuch), said that even though the agency fees in theory related only to the union&#x2019;s collective&#x2D;bargaining activities, the compulsory&#x2D;fee arrangement <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;violates the free speech rights of nonmembers </span>by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">compelling them to subsidize private speech</span> on matters of substantial public concern[.]&#x201d; Therefore, the union could no longer have the agency fee deducted from a non&#x2D;member&#x2019;s wages; only if the non&#x2D;member affirmatively consented to pay would the union receive the fee.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="124736"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#x201c;Exacting scrutiny&#x201d; test is chosen&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="124738"></a>  To reach this result, Alito had to select a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">standard</span> to be used in determining whether the agency&#x2D;fee statute violated the First Amendment rights of non&#x2D;union&#x2D;members. He selected a standard the Court had used in other compulsory&#x2D;speech contexts, one using <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;exacting scrutiny.&#x201d;</span> <a id="Ch14__FNB_17" name="Ch14__FNB_17"></a><a  href="#Ch14__FNH_17"><sup>17</sup></a> <span style="font-size : 11.50pt;">Under &#x201c;exacting&#x201d; scrutiny, he said, the compelled subsidy must &#x201c;serve a </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;">compelling state interest </span><span style="font-size : 11.50pt;">that cannot be achieved through </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;">means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.&#x201d;</span><span style="font-size : 11.50pt;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="124744"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Test is flunked&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="124745"></a> Alito then quickly determined that for several reasons, the Illinois statute could not satisfy the exacting&#x2D;scrutiny standard.

That case was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.

The NAACP opened an Alabama office that supported desegregation in higher education and public transportation. NAACP members were then threatened with economic reprisals and violence.

The Form 99&#x30; is a form every charity is required to file annually with the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the form requires the charity to list the names and addresses of any donor who contributed more than &#x24;5,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; in the relevant year. California was thus requiring every charity soliciting contributions in the state to tell the state the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">names and addresses of every major donor.</span> The state promised to keep the information <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">confidential</span>; however, prior to the suit, the Attorney General office had inadvertently posted at least 2,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; Form 99&#x30;s to the Department&#x2019;s website, thus making their contents public.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144803"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; The state&#x2019;s interest&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144804"></a> In California, one of the jobs of the Attorney General&#x2019;s office is to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">supervise charitable fundraising. </span>The Attorney General defended the Form 99&#x30; disclosure requirement as a means of furthering the state&#x2019;s interest in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">preventing &#x201c;charitable fraud and self&#x2D;dealing.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="149003"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Efficiency argument&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="148994"></a> Even had there been no automatic &#x201c;up&#x2D;front&#x201d; disclosure scheme, the Attorney General would have been free to subpoena the Form 99&#x30; from any particular charity the A.G. wanted to investigate.

The Ps argued that by requiring them to file their Form 99&#x30;s, the state was violating each charity&#x2019;s (and the charity&#x2019;s donors&#x2019;) First Amendment freedom of association. In part because of the inadvertent leaks of Form 99&#x30;s mentioned above, the Ps argued, the disclosure scheme and related leakage risks made it <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">harder for them to fund&#x2D;raise</span>, by subjecting their donors to the risk of reprisals and harassment from the public.<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="144807"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facial attack&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="144808"></a> An important aspect of the Ps&#x2019; suit was the Ps&#x2019; claim that the disclosure requirement was not only a violation of freedom&#x2D;of&#x2D;association &#x201c;as applied&#x201d; to each P and its donors, but was also <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">invalid &#x201c;on its face,&#x201d;</span> i.e., that it could not constitutionally be applied to <span style="font-style:Italic;">any</span> charity.<a id="Ch14__FNB_22" name="Ch14__FNB_22"></a><a  href="#Ch14__FNH_22"><sup>22</sup></a><br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="144810"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; The holding&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="144811"></a> By a 6&#x2D;3 vote, the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Ps prevailed </span>in the Supreme Court.

The government, he said, does <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> need to choose the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;least restrictive means&#x201d; </span>of achieving the relevant interest. But, he continued, the means must be<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> &#x201c;narrowly tailored&#x201d;</span> to the achievement that asserted interest.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144819"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Applying the &#x201c;important interest&#x201d; requirement&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144820"></a> Roberts then turned to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">applying</span> the exacting&#x2D;scrutiny standard to the actual California disclosure regime at issue. As to the &#x201c;sufficiently important governmental interest&#x201d; prong &#x2014; i.e. the &#x201c;end&#x201d; being sought by government &#x2014; Roberts quickly conceded that California&#x2019;s interest in &#x201c;preventing wrongdoing by charitable organizations&#x201d; was indeed <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;sufficiently important.&#x201d;<br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144821"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_153668" name="index_153668"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3ENARROW%20TAILORING:Requirement%20of" id="%3C$startrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Requirement_of" name="%3C$startrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Requirement_of"></a>Applying the &#x201c;narrowly&#x2D;tailored&#x201d; requirement&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144822"></a> Roberts then applied the other prong of exacting scrutiny &#x2014; that the means chosen must be<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> &#x201c;narrowly tailored&#x201d;</span> to the governmental interest which that means promotes. As in most constitutional challenges triggering either intermediate&#x2D;review or strict scrutiny, the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;tightness of fit&#x201d; </span>between the end and the means was where the problem lay. Here, Roberts said, there was a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;dramatic mismatch&#x201d; </span>between the A.G.&#x2019;s interest in combating fraud and the broad disclosure regime he implemented. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="144830"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; No instances&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="144831"></a> For starters, the A.G. had not been able to point to even a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;single, concrete instance&#x201d; </span>in which the collection of a Form 99&#x30; had done anything to &#x201c;advance the Attorney General&#x2019;s investigative, regulatory or enforcement efforts.&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="144832"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Need for universal production&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="144833"></a> Furthermore, Roberts said, even if the A.G. <span style="font-style:Italic;">had</span> actually relied on up&#x2D;front collection in some cases, that modest reliance would fall &#x201c;far short&#x201d; of the means&#x2D;end fit required by the exacting&#x2D;scrutiny standard. This prong required the state to show that &#x201c;universal production&#x201d; was needed <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;in light of any less intrusive alternatives.&#x201d;</span> <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="144834"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Subpoenas as an alternative&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="144835"></a> The A.G. had argued that alternative means of obtaining the Form 99&#x30;s &#x2014; such as <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">subpoenas</span> or <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">letters announcing an audit</span> &#x2014; were less efficient than up&#x2D;front collection. But, Roberts said, the record showed that the A.G. had never even <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;considered&#x201d; </span>these alternatives to universal up&#x2D;front collection, weakening the A.G.&#x2019;s claim that this was not a viable less&#x2D;intrusive alternative. <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="144840"></a><span class="BoldBody">(2)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>&#x201c;Administrative efficient not a sufficient goal&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="146950"></a> Roberts concluded that the main interest that California was pursuing by its universal up&#x2D;front disclosure regime was not investigating fraud but rather, achieving <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;ease of administration.&#x201d; </span> However, he said, the highly burdensome up&#x2D;front disclosure system was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not narrowly&#x2D;tailored </span>towards achieving this relatively weak state interest in &#x201c;mere administrative convenience.&#x201d;<span style="font-weight:Bold;"><a id="index_153682" name="index_153682"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW%20TAILORING:Requirement%20of" id="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Requirement_of" name="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Requirement_of"></a> </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"><a id="index_153913" name="index_153913"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW%20TAILORING:Compulsory%20disclosure%20of%20association’s%20members%20as%20requiring" id="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Compulsory_disclosure_of_association’s_members_as_requiring" name="%3C$endrange%3ENARROW_TAILORING_Compulsory_disclosure_of_association’s_members_as_requiring"></a><br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144842"></a>e.&#160;&#160;&#160; Scheme is &#x201c;facially invalid&#x201d;&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144843"></a> Roberts then turned to the issue that may well prove to be the most far&#x2D;reaching aspect of the decision&#x3A; whether the disclosure regime was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;invalid on its face.&#x201d; </span>So far, we&#x2019;ve seen how his majority opinion decided that the disclosure scheme here violated the freedom&#x2D;of&#x2D;association rights of the two particular plaintiff charities who brought the suit (making this at least a successful &#x201c;as applied&#x201d; challenge).

But in the Court&#x2019;s prior decisions, what had always mattered were the risks that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;actually result[ed] from disclosure&#x201d;;</span> only after the plaintiffs showed an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">actual burden</span> had the Court then required means&#x2D;end tailoring, and the level of that tailoring was proportional to that particular burden. But now, she said, the Court had abandoned that established approach, by &#x201c;holding that narrow tailoring applies to disclosure requirements <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">across the board,</span> even if there is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no evidence that they burden anyone at all.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="144862"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; No need for exacting scrutiny&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4Text" id="144863"></a>  Sotomayor sharply disagreed with this approach. The plaintiffs here had not produced <span style="font-style:Italic;">any</span> &#x201c;evidence of tangible burdens&#x201d; at all. Therefore, there was no need for the Court to perform any exacting scrutiny. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144864"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Tailor the level of scrutiny to the degree of burden&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144865"></a> Similarly, Sotomayor contended, in heightened&#x2D;scrutiny cases the Court had always <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">adjusted</span> the required tightness of means&#x2D;end fit in order to match the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">magnitude of the burden</span> the government was placing on the group&#x2019;s freedom of association. Now, the majority was unwisely shifting from this &#x201c;nuanced approach&#x201d; to a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d;</span> test &#x2014; no matter whether the burdens the government was placing on associational rights were slight, heavy, or nonexistent, the Court was requiring that the disclosure regime <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">always be narrowly tailored. </span>This created a significant risk that disclosure requirements that should be constitutional would be struck down, Sotomayor said.<br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144866"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Overbreadth&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144867"></a> Finally, Sotomayor was especially critical of the majority&#x2019;s conclusion that the disclosure scheme was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;facially invalid&#x201d;</span> &#x2014; and thus could not be enforced against <span style="font-style:Italic;">any</span> charity &#x2014; rather than merely invalid &#x201c;as applied&#x201d; to the two charities who had brought the suit. She conceded that facial attacks are (and should be) easier to win in the First Amendment area than in other contexts, because of the risk that imprecisely&#x2D;drawn regulations will have a broad chilling effect on speech or association. <br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="148240"></a>But even in the First Amendment area, she said, the Court had never allowed a facial attack to succeed unless the regulation was shown to be unconstitutional in a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;substantial number of &#x2026; applications </span>&#x2026; judged <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">in relation to</span> the statute&#x2019;s <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">plainly legitimate sweep.&#x201d; </span>Here, given the desire of many charitable donors to have their donations publicized, the plaintiffs had &#x201c;fail[ed] to show that a substantial proportion of those affected would prefer anonymity, much less that they are objectively burdened by the loss of it.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144870"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#x201c;Marked with a bull&#x2019;s&#x2D;eye&#x201d;&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144871"></a> In sum, Sotomayor said, the Court had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;mark[ed] reporting and disclosure requirements with a bull&#x2019;s&#x2D;eye.&#x201d; <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="144872"></a>5.&#160;&#160;&#160; Possible extensions to other disclosure regimes&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_L6Text" id="144878"></a> The logic of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity</span> seems to render unconstitutional a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">wide variety of state and federal disclosure requirements, </span>not just in the area of charitable donations but also in the domain of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">campaign finance. <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="144879"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; IRS charitable disclosure requirements&#x3A; <br/></p><p class="_L8Text" id="144880"></a> For instance, recall that the requirement struck down in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity </span>was that each non&#x2D;profit file with the state the non&#x2D;profit&#x2019;s IRS Form 99&#x30;, listing each significant donor&#x2019;s identity and the amount they contributed.

The Court has virtually always <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">denied</span> any special exemption for the press. For instance, if a state&#x2019;s generally applicable procedural rules allow a person to be forced to give <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">testimony</span> to a grand jury or petit jury, then the press must obey those rules like anyone else. See <span style="font-style:Italic;">Branzburg v. Hayes</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_25792_123">634</a>.

The press may have a right of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">access</span> to newsworthy information within the government&#x2019;s control &#x2014; such a right of access for the press, based on general free&#x2D;expression principles, may have been recognized by the Court in the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Richmond Newspapers</span> case, <span style="font-style:Italic;">infra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_14964_123">638</a>.<br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="13031"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Government can&#x2019;t single out press&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="13032"></a> Regardless of whether the press has special rights, what is clear is that government may not <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">single out</span> the press for <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">unfavorable</span> treatment. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="13033"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_15279_123" name="XREF_15279_123">Taxation&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="13034"></a> This has been clearest in cases involving <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">taxation</span>. The government may not impose a tax that applies to newspapers (or all media) but that is not generally applicable. Thus in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Minneapolis Star &#x26; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm&#x2019;r of Revenue</span>, 46&#x30; U.S. 525 (1983), the Court held that a special Minnesota &#x201c;use tax&#x201d; applicable only to the cost of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">paper and ink</span> consumed in the production of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">publications</span>, violated the First Amendment. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="13035"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rationale&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="12274"></a> The Court did not find any evidence that the Minnesota legislature had tried to censor or chill the press. But the tax was a special one, not part of the state&#x2019;s generally&#x2D;applicable use tax. Therefore, the Court concluded, the state had &#x201c;singled out the press for special treatment.&#x201d; Consequently, the tax had to be strictly scrutinized &#x2014; it would be invalid unless &#x201c;necessary to achieve an overriding governmental interest.&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="12256"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#x201c;Chilling&#x201d; effect&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="12257"></a> There was evidence that the particular tax here was not especially burdensome to the press (since it was at the same percentage rate as the general state sales and use taxes, and applied only to paper and ink, not to the total price of the newspaper). Nonetheless, because the state had singled out the press, the &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">political constraints</span> that prevent a legislature from passing crippling taxes of general applicability are weakened, and the threat of burdensome taxes becomes acute.&#x201d; The <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">mere threat</span> of crippling taxes might well have a censorial effect, the Court argued. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="12262"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Strict scrutiny test failed&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="12263"></a> The statute was not able to withstand the strict scrutiny to which the Court subjected it. The state&#x2019;s interest in raising revenue might be a compelling one (the Court did not say); but the singling out of the press for a special tax was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not a necessary means</span> of achieving that objective. The state could, for instance, simply have made newspaper sales part of the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">general state sales tax</span> already in force. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="12264"></a>iv.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="12265"></a> Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, argued that not all &#x201c;differential treatment,&#x201d; but only that differential treatment which <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">burdens</span> the press, should be strictly scrutinized. Here, he calculated, the use tax was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">more favorable</span> to the press than, say, a sales tax set at the same percentage, but applicable to the newspaper&#x2019;s gross revenues. Therefore, there was a &#x201c;benefit&#x201d; to the press, not a &#x201c;burden.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="12266"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_21751_123" name="XREF_21751_123">Taxation based </a><a id="index_15337" name="index_15337"></a><a data-indexterm="taxation:Cumulative%20burdens:Based%20on%20content" id="TAXATION_Based_on_content" name="TAXATION_Based_on_content"></a>on content&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="12267"></a> Where a tax operates differently upon different members of the press depending on the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">content</span> of a publication, it is even more likely to be found invalid. In the post&#x2D;<span style="font-style:Italic;">Minneapolis Star</span> case of <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Arkansas Writer&#x2019;s Project, Inc. v. Ragland</span>, 481 U.S. 221 (1987), an Arkansas statute that taxed general interest magazines, but exempted newspapers and other special&#x2D;interest publications, was invalidated by the Court. The fact that the tax did not discriminate among particular <span style="font-style:Italic;">views</span>, merely among subject areas, was not sufficient to save the statute. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="12268"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Exemption that is denied to large category&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="12269"></a> On the other hand, where a generally&#x2D;applicable tax is applied to most media as well as to non&#x2D;media, and an exemption is given to a certain media segment, denial of the exemption to the rest of the media seems <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> to be unconstitutional. Thus if a state has a generally&#x2D;applicable sales tax on goods and services, it may decide to cover cable TV services while continuing to exempt newspapers, magazines, and satellite broadcast services. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Leathers v. Medlock</span>, 499 U.S. 439 (1991). The idea seems to be that as long as it is not the case that a small segment of the media is singled out for negative treatment, the fact that some segment of the media <span style="font-style:Italic;">is</span> given an exemption is irrelevant. <br/></p><p class="_L4Capt" id="11553"></a>C.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_28273_123" name="XREF_28273_123">Prior res</a><a id="index_14083" name="index_14083"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Media:Prior%20restraints" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Prior_restraints" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Prior_restraints"></a><a id="index_14084" name="index_14084"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Prior_restraints" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Prior_restraints"></a>traints&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L4Text" id="11554"></a> A key aim of the drafters of the First Amendment was to forbid any system of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">prior restraints</span>, similar to the English licensing scheme, by which nothing could be published without government or church approval. This aim remains a vital part of modern First Amendment doctrine, so that any governmental action which prevents expression from occurring (as distinguished from punishing it once it has occurred) is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">presumed to be constitutionally invalid</span>. This is all the more true where the prior restraint is directed against the organized press. See Tribe, p. 1&#x30;41. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11555"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Pro<a id="index_14085" name="index_14085"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints:Distinguished%20from%20subsequent%20punishment" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Distinguished_from_subsequent_punishment" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Distinguished_from_subsequent_punishment"></a>cedural obstacles&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="49128"></a> The dangers of prior restraints also stem from the fact that procedural rules applied in American courts make such restraints more likely to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;chill&#x201d;</span> the exercise of First Amendment rights than would a subsequent punishment. Where a person is sought to be punished <span style="font-style:Italic;">after</span> his speech&#x2D;related conduct, he is completely free to raise the claim that the statute at issue is unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied to him. But where a person is enjoined <span style="font-style:Italic;">prior</span> to his expressive act, and yet goes ahead and does that act anyway, he will not be permitted to argue that either the underlying statute or the injunction was unconstitutional as applied to him (though he may argue that the statute was void on its face). See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Walker v. City of Birmingham</span>, 388 U.S. 3&#x30;7 (1967). Thus an unconstitutionally&#x2D;imposed prior restraint is likely to cow the defendant into forgoing his First Amendment rights, at least during the length of time it takes to conduct an appeal. See Tribe, pp. 1&#x30;42&#x2D;45. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11557"></a>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Examples of prior restraints&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11558"></a> There are two basic types of pre&#x2D;publication restraints. One consists of governmental orders and court injunctions telling a particular person that he cannot engage in a certain type of communication. The other consists of a scheme requiring a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">license or permit</span> before a particular type of expression may be engaged in. Movie&#x2D;censorship schemes are illustrations of the latter category. All of the cases involving the organized press, with which we are concerned here, are of the governmental&#x2D;order or court&#x2D;injunction type. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11559"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_24499_123" name="XREF_24499_123" style="font-style:Italic;">Near v. Minnesota&#x3A;</a></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11560"></a> The classic case articulating the heavy presumption against prior restraints is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Near v. Minnesota</span>, 283 U.S. 697 (1931). <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11561"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11562"></a> In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Near</span>, a state procedure for closing down as a public nuisance any &#x201c;malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper&#x201d; was used to permanently enjoin the publication of a newspaper which criticized local officials. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11563"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11564"></a> In striking the injunction as an unconstitutional infringement of free speech, the Court held that the primary aim of the First Amendment was to prevent pre&#x2D;publication restraints. The proper remedy for false accusations against public officials was by a post&#x2D;publication libel action, not by a pre&#x2D;publication procedure which the Court found to be tantamount to censorship. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11565"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Exceptional cases&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11566"></a> The prohibition on prior restraints, in the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Near</span> Court&#x2019;s view, was almost, but not quite, complete. There could be a few &#x201c;exceptional cases&#x201d; in which prior restraint would be permissible; the Court gave as illustrations actual obstruction of recruitment for the armed forces, and publication of &#x201c;the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11567"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Burden of proof&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11568"></a> One aspect of the Minnesota statute to which the Court took particular exception was that the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">burden of proof</span> was placed <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">upon the publisher</span> to show his truthfulness or good faith, rather than on the party seeking the injunction to show falsity or malice. However, nothing in the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Near</span> opinion (or in subsequent case law) suggests that placing the burden of proof in these issues on the party seeking the injunction would validate such a generalized prior restraint scheme. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11569"></a>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Pent<a id="index_14086" name="index_14086"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints:Strict%20scrutiny%20of" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Strict_scrutiny_of" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Strict_scrutiny_of"></a>agon Papers case&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11570"></a> The only other case to reach the Court on the issue of prior restraint of political speech is the famous <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Pentagon Papers</span> case, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">New York Times Co. v. U.S.</span>, 4&#x30;3 U.S. 713 (1971). This case establishes that the press has <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">almost absolute immunity</span> from pre&#x2D;publication restraints. See Tribe, p. 1&#x30;39. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11571"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11572"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> The New York Times</span> and <span style="font-style:Italic;">The Washington Post</span> began publishing portions of a secret Defense Department study (popularly known as the &#x201c;Pentagon Papers&#x201d;) of U.S. policy in Vietnam. The government sought an injunction against the two papers to prevent further publication. The government conceded that the Papers discussed only historical events which transpired prior to 1968, but argued that publication would prolong the War by giving the enemy information useful to it and would embarrass our diplomatic efforts. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11573"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Per curiam </span>opinion&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11574"></a> The opinion of the Court was a brief <span style="font-style:Italic;">per curiam</span> one, which recited prior case law that there is a heavy presumption against the constitutionality of prior restraints, but which contained no other reasoning. By a 6&#x2D;3 vote, the Court determined that the government was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not entitled</span> to the injunctions. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11575"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Nine separate opinions&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11576"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"> Every member</span> of the Court wrote a separate opinion, and no majority of the Court agreed on a precise rationale for the decision.

This group, consisting of Brennan, Stewart, White and Marshall, argued that there must be a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">virtual certainty</span> that grave damage to the country would result if publication were not enjoined; as Justice Stewart, joined by White, expressed the test, there must be a showing that disclosure &#x201c;will <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">surely result</span> in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">direct, immediate, and irreparable damage</span> to our Nation or its people.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11583"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Danger not substantially certain&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11584"></a> Most or all of these Justices seemed to believe that publication would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">probably</span> damage the nation. It was only because there was not a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial certainty</span> of such damage that they voted to strike the injunction. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11585"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Absence of statutory authorization&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11586"></a> To all of these four Justices except Brennan, an important weakness of the government&#x2019;s position was that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no statute</span> provided for an injunction against news publication in circumstances like these. Separation of powers principles made it impermissible for the Court to issue an injunction where Congress had declined to act. (But Justices Stewart and White seemed to say that even in the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">absence</span> of statutory authorization, a certainty of direct, immediate and irreparable damage to the country might permit issuance of an injunction. This view would probably command a majority of the Court today. See 94 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harv. L.

They criticized the haste with which the Court heard and decided the case. (Less than one week elapsed between filing of the case and announcement of the decision.) Only one Justice, Harlan, formulated a test for evaluating the constitutionality of such injunctions. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11589"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Harlan&#x2019;s test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11590"></a> In Harlan&#x2019;s view, the Court&#x2019;s role should be limited to determining&#x3A; (1) whether the subject matter of the dispute lies within the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">proper scope</span> of the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">President&#x2019;s foreign relations power</span>; and if the answer is &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; (2) whether the determination that disclosure would irreparably impair the national security was personally made by the head of the relevant executive department, here, the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. If the answer to this question, too, was &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; the injunction should be upheld. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11591"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rationale&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11592"></a> Harlan argued that it was a violation of separation of powers principles for the judiciary to go beyond these two inquiries and to &#x201c;redetermine for itself the probable impact of disclosure on the national security.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11593"></a>g.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="index_14090" name="index_14090"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints:Receipt%20of%20stolen%20goods%20as%20exception%20to" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Receipt_of_stolen_goods_as_exception_to" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Receipt_of_stolen_goods_as_exception_to"></a>Receipt of stolen goods&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11594"></a> As is well known, the newspapers&#x2019; source for the Pentagon Papers was Daniel Ellsberg, who was given them in confidence while he did work for the government.

No subsequent case to reach the Court has faced this question squarely. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11595"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Difficulty&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11596"></a> One difficulty with allowing an injunction based on such a receivership&#x2D;of&#x2D;stolen&#x2D;goods theory is that &#x201c;requiring a newspaper to decide at its peril whether information that it has received about an official proceeding is confidential would have a chilling effect upon the publication of legitimate news.&#x201d; 94 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harv.

In <span style="font-style:Italic;">U.S. v. The Progressive, Inc.</span>, 467 F. Supp. 99&#x30; (W.D. Wis. 1979), the district court enjoined a magazine from publishing an article containing <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">technical information about the H&#x2D;bomb</span>. At least some of the materials had previously been declassified. But the U.S. convinced the court that these materials, taken together with other classified information (also sought to be released by the magazine), could pose a direct threat to national security by possibly &#x201c;allow[ing] a medium size nation to move faster in developing a hydrogen weapon.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11603"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rationale&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11604"></a> The judge reasoned that two main considerations made this case distinguishable from the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Pentagon Papers</span> case&#x3A; (1) here, a statute, the Atomic Energy Act, authorized an injunction against publication of certain information relating to the use or manufacture of nuclear weapons (including some of the information in the proposed article); and (2) publication might well lead to nuclear proliferation, which in turn might lead to &#x201c;thermonuclear annihilation for us all.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11605"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Balancing test&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11606"></a> The court then balanced the dangers to the paper&#x2019;s First Amendment rights against the danger to the nation. As to the former, although the injunction might interfere with the magazine&#x2019;s broadly&#x2D;defined First Amendment rights, it would not interfere with its &#x201c;laudable crusade to stimulate public knowledge of nuclear armament and bring about enlightened debate on national policy questions.&#x201d; The balance was struck in favor of the injunction; the &#x201c;disparity of risk&#x201d; between the danger to the nation and the damage to the paper&#x2019;s First Amendment rights justified what the court conceded was &#x201c;the first instance of prior restraint against a publication in this fashion in the history of this country.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11609"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_20835_123" name="XREF_20835_123">Outcome&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11610"></a> Before the paper&#x2019;s appeal could be heard, the government&#x2019;s attempt to get a permanent injunction against it was dropped, because the information was published elsewhere. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11611"></a>6.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_37299_123" name="XREF_37299_123">&#x201c;Ga</a><a id="index_14092" name="index_14092"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Gag%20order%20to%20preserve%20fair%20trial" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Gag_order_to_preserve_fair_trial" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Gag_order_to_preserve_fair_trial"></a>g ord<a id="index_14093" name="index_14093"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints:Gag%20orders%20to%20preserve%20fair%20trial" id="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Gag_orders_to_preserve_fair_trial" name="%3C$startrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Gag_orders_to_preserve_fair_trial"></a>ers&#x201d; and preservation of fair trials&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11612"></a> The media&#x2019;s exercise of its First Amendment rights may sometimes come into conflict with a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">criminal defendant&#x2019;s right to a fair trial</span>. Extensive pre&#x2D;trial publicity, including disclosure of confessions (possibly inadmissible) by the defendant, may make it much more difficult to find jurors who can be impartial. Nonetheless, the United States has never gone even a single step towards the English rule, which makes illegal the pre&#x2D;trial publication of information that might cause prejudice. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11613"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Standard for biased jury&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11614"></a> If the defendant can show that the jury was biased against him, he is entitled to a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">reversal</span> of his conviction. But it is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> sufficient for him to show that the jurors had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">knowledge before they were sworn in about the facts and issues involved in the case</span> &#x2014; requiring complete ignorance would be virtually impossible in important trials, given today&#x2019;s mass communications. Rather, the defendant must show that the jury was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">prejudiced</span> against him as the result of pre&#x2D;trial publicity. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11617"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Publicity during trial&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11618"></a> Similarly, publicity <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">during</span> the trial may be so great that, if the jury is exposed to it, the defendant&#x2019;s right to a fair trial will be found to have been violated. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;">Sheppard v. Maxwell</span>, 384 U.S. 333 (1966), the famous Sam Sheppard murder case, where massive prejudicial publicity during the trial, to which the jury was exposed, was held to be grounds for reversal; the Court observed that the problem could have been avoided by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">sequestering</span> the jury for the length of the trial. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11619"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_22033_123" name="XREF_22033_123">Gag orders&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11620"></a> Because of these dangers of publicity, especially before the trial begins, trial judges have sought ways of assuring that they will be able to find an unbiased jury. One appealing method that some seized upon is the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;gag order,&#x201d;</span> a pre&#x2D;trial order <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">prohibiting the press from publishing certain types of information</span> about the case. But as the result of the one case involving a gag order to reach the Court, such orders will <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">almost never be constitutionally permissible</span>. That case is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Nebraska Press Ass&#x2019;n v. Stuart</span>, 427 U.S. 539 (1976). <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11621"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Facts of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Nebraska Press&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11622"></a> In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Nebraska Press</span>, a man was about to be tried for a heinous mass murder, which had attracted widespread media attention. The trial judge, in order to assure his ability to select an unprejudiced jury, issued an order prohibiting the press from reporting any confessions or admissions by the defendant, or any other fact &#x201c;strongly implicative&#x201d; of him, until after impaneling of the jury. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11623"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11624"></a> The Supreme Court held unanimously that the gag order <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">violated</span> the press&#x2019; First Amendment rights. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11625"></a>iii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Majority opinion&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11626"></a> The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice Burger, with whom four other Justices joined. Burger declined to hold that a ban on pretrial publicity could <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">never</span> be constitutional. Instead, he applied a test long ago advocated by Learned Hand for subversive&#x2D;advocacy cases&#x3A; the restraint should be allowed only if the &#x201c;gravity of the ‘evil,&#x2019; discounted by its improbability&#x201d; is greater than the damage from impairment of First Amendment rights. <br/></p><p class="_M4CaptSubPar" id="26436"></a><span class="BoldBody">(1)&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Standard not met&#x3A;<br/></p><p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="26437"></a>Here, Burger said, this test was not satisfied. The trial judge&#x2019;s conclusion that pretrial publicity would impair the defendant&#x2019;s rights &#x201c;was of necessity <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">speculative</span>,&#x201d; rather than certain. Furthermore, the trial judge should have considered <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">other alternatives</span> for reducing the harmful effect of such publicity (e.g., change of venue, postponement of trial, careful <span style="font-style:Italic;">voir dire</span>, restricting statements by the lawyers, police and witnesses, etc.). Finally, the trial judge should have considered whether his gag order would even be effective, in view of the rumors which usually circulate in a sensational case. On balance, then, it was not sufficiently established that the benefits of the gag order outweighed its First Amendment dangers. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11629"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Significance&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11630"></a><span style="font-style:Italic;"> Nebraska Press</span> probably presents about the strongest case imaginable for a gag order furthering the right of fair trial. Therefore, the result of that decision is that such orders will virtually never be constitutional, at least as long as the press acquires its information without violating the law. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11631"></a>e.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dist<a id="index_14094" name="index_14094"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints:Distinguished%20from%20subsequent%20punishment" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Distinguished_from_subsequent_punishment" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Distinguished_from_subsequent_punishment"></a>inguished from subsequent punishment&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11632"></a> What made the order in <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Nebraska Press</span> a &#x201c;prior restraint&#x201d; was not simply that it forbade publishing a certain type of material; it was that the restriction took the form of an order applicable to one particular, specifically&#x2D;identified factual setting (this particular trial). Had the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">legislature</span> made it a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">crime</span> to publish prejudicial information in advance of <span style="font-style:Italic;">any</span> criminal trial, such a statute could <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not properly be termed a prior restraint</span>, and would <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> necessarily be unconstitutional. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11633"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Analysis&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11634"></a> General First Amendment principles might be interpreted to make such a statute violative of freedom of expression, but the heavy presumption against prior restraints would have nothing to do with the decision. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11635"></a>f.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_17681_123" name="XREF_17681_123">Silenci</a><a id="index_14095" name="index_14095"></a><a data-indexterm="FREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Lawyers,%20comments%20by" id="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Lawyers,_comments_by" name="FREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Lawyers,_comments_by"></a>ng the lawyer&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="26452"></a> The &#x201c;gag order&#x201d; in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Nebraska Press</span> was directed at the media; the case establishes that such press&#x2D;directed orders will rarely be constitutional.

The Court upheld a Nevada rule patterned on the American Bar Association&#x2019;s Model Rule (prohibiting statements posing a substantial likelihood of material prejudice) over the lawyer&#x2019;s claim that a &#x201c;clear and present danger&#x201d; standard should be used. <a id="index_26454" name="index_26454"></a><a data-indexterm="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM%20OF%20SPEECH:Prior%20restraints:Gag%20orders%20to%20preserve%20fair%20trial" id="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Gag_orders_to_preserve_fair_trial" name="%3C$endrange%3EFREEDOM_OF_SPEECH_Gag_orders_to_preserve_fair_trial"></a><br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="26458"></a>g.&#160;&#160;&#160; <a id="XREF_24905_123" name="XREF_24905_123">Closure orders&#x3A;</a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11642"></a> Since trial judges will almost never be permitted to use a pre&#x2D;trial gag order directed at the press, an obvious alternative is for them simply to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">close pretrial proceedings to the public (and press)</span>.

Typically, the government seeks such disclosure as part of its <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">law enforcement</span> efforts. The two Supreme Court cases on point, one involving a grand jury investigation and the other the use of an <span style="font-style:Italic;">ex parte</span> search warrant, indicate that the press is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not entitled to any special First Amendment protection</span> against what would otherwise be proper compulsory disclosure of information obtained during news&#x2D;gathering. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11649"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Indirect impact on First Amendment rights&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11650"></a> Observe that the nature of the interference with First Amendment expression is quite different in this compulsory&#x2D;disclosure setting than in the prior restraint area. In the latter setting, restraint is almost always sought <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">because of the communicative impact</span> which publication would have; thus prior restraints almost always call for &#x201c;track one&#x201d; analysis (to use Tribe&#x2019;s term), and strict scrutiny is obviously appropriate. But in the compulsory disclosure area, any interference with First Amendment expression (e.g., the drying up of information from informants, because they are afraid their confidentiality will not be preserved) is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">incidental to,</span> not the purpose of, the disclosure. Therefore, these cases call for &#x201c;track two&#x201d; analysis, which as noted (<span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_10084_123">488</a>) is handled by a much less stringent balancing of harms and benefits. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court has been much less quick to accept the press&#x2019; arguments in the compulsory&#x2D;disclosure area than in the context of prior restraints.

Hayes</span>, 4&#x30;8 U.S. 665 (1972), the Court held by a 5&#x2D;4 vote that requiring newsmen to testify before <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">grand juries</span> concerning <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">information obtained from confidential sources</span> during news&#x2D;gathering does <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not</span> violate the First Amendment. In so deciding, the Court <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">rejected</span> journalists&#x2019; requests for at least a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">qualified privilege</span> to refuse to disclose the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">identities of confidential sources</span> or the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">information</span> received from them. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11653"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Journalists&#x2019; argument&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11654"></a> The argument raised by Branzburg and two other journalists was that news&#x2D;gathering often requires confidential sources, who agree to supply the journalist with otherwise unavailable information only if non&#x2D;disclosure of the informant&#x2019;s name and&#47;or some of the information is promised. If a grand jury could compel disclosure, the journalists argued, not only the source of the particular information sought, but other confidential sources in the future, would be dissuaded from talking to journalists. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11655"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Holding&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11656"></a> In rejecting the claim for a privilege, the Court held that such a privilege had never been found to exist, and that journalists had always been viewed as having the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">same duty as any other citizen</span> to disclose to grand juries information about crime. The majority was not convinced that a significant portion of information supplied by confidential sources would dry up, especially since such information was widely available to newsmen even though no privilege had ever been recognized. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11657"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Balancing&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11658"></a> Even if significant impairment of confidential sources did occur, the majority saw no reason why &#x201c;[t]he public interest in possible future news about crime from undisclosed, unverified sources&#x201d; should take precedence over the governmental interest in prosecuting crimes about which journalists possess evidence. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11659"></a>ii.&#160;&#160;&#160; Definitional problem&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11660"></a> Also, the majority saw a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">definitional</span> problem&#x3A; recognition of a privilege would require the courts either to decide that only the &#x201c;organized press&#x201d; should be protected (and to define that term), or to make the privilege dangerously broad by protecting &#x201c;lectures, political pollsters, novelists, academic researchers, dramatists&#x201d; and anyone else claiming to be informing the public and to be relying on confidential sources. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11661"></a>c.&#160;&#160;&#160; Qualified privilege rejected&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11662"></a> The majority also rejected even a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">qualified</span> privilege, by which disclosure of confidential information could not be compelled unless the state showed that a crime had been committed and that the journalist possessed relevant information not available from other sources. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11663"></a>d.&#160;&#160;&#160; Protection against harassment&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11664"></a> But the majority preserved the right of a journalist to obtain relief against <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">harassment</span>, e.g., a subpoena issued not to pursue law enforcement ends but for the purpose of disrupting the reporter&#x2019;s relationship with his news sources (perhaps because of official displeasure with the newsman&#x2019;s work). However, so long as the questions were relevant and material, and were part of a good faith grand jury investigation, the newsman could not decline to answer. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11665"></a>e.&#160;&#160;&#160; Powell&#x2019;s concurrence&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11666"></a> The crucial fifth vote was supplied by Justice Powell, who although he joined the Court&#x2019;s opinion submitted a separate concurrence as well; this concurrence made the result of the case somewhat ambiguous. Whereas the other four members of the majority rejected a qualified privilege, and left room only for a defense of harassment, Justice Powell&#x2019;s concurrence stated that claims of privilege should be decided on a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">case&#x2D;by&#x2D;case basis</span>, by balancing freedom of the press against the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony. Powell suggested, for instance, that a newsman may obtain relief if he can show that he has been asked for information bearing &#x201c;only a remote and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation,&#x201d; or that his confidential sources would be compromised &#x201c;without a legitimate need of law enforcement.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11667"></a>f.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissent&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11668"></a> Three of the four dissenters in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Branzburg</span> did not argue for an absolute privilege against grand jury disclosure of confidential sources. But they did support a type of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">strict scrutiny</span> of such compulsory disclosure, by which the government would have to make three showings before a reporter could be required to reveal confidences&#x3A; (1) that there is &#x201c;probable cause to believe that the newsman has information which is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">clearly relevant</span> to a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">specific probable violation of law</span>;&#x201d; (2) that the information cannot be obtained by &#x201c;<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">alternative means</span> less destructive of First Amendment rights&#x201d;; and (3) that the government has a &#x201c;compelling and overriding interest&#x201d; in the information. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11669"></a>i.&#160;&#160;&#160; Relation to Powell&#x2019;s view&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11670"></a> As the dissenters pointed out, this type of qualified privilege may not be so different from the position taken by Justice Powell. The absolute position taken by the other four members of the majority, by contrast, would &#x201c;annex the journalistic profession as an investigative arm of government,&#x201d; the dissenters argued. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11671"></a>3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Limited scope of ruling&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11672"></a> In addition to grand jury proceedings, the rationale of <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Branzburg</span> obviously applies to <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">criminal trials</span> as well. But it is not clear that the theory of <span style="font-style:Italic;">Branzburg</span> also deprives newsmen of a constitutional privilege regarding testimony in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">civil suits</span>. Some lower courts have granted a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">qualified privilege</span> in this situation, which may be overcome only by a showing that the confidentially&#x2D;obtained information is not available from other sources.

In <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia</span>, 448 U.S. 555 (198&#x30;), the Court answered this question largely in the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">negative</span>, holding that &#x201c;absent an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">overriding interest</span> articulated in findings,&#x201d; the First Amendment requires that &#x201c;[t]he <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">trial of a criminal case must be open to the public</span>.&#x201d; Although the vote was 7&#x2D;1, there was no majority opinion, and the precise scope of the decision remains unclear. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11755"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; Significance of case&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11756"></a> At a minimum, <span style="font-style:Italic;">Richmond Newspapers</span> establishes that the public and press have a First Amendment right to attend criminal trials, and that entire trials can be closed only if that right is outweighed by <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">overriding</span> interests which <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">cannot be satisfied by less restrictive means</span>.

For instance, the public has a right to attend the <span style="font-style:Italic;">voir dire</span> of the jury; see <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Press Enterprise Co. v.

For instance, testimony of a particular witness might be held outside of the presence of the public, in order to prevent other witnesses from hearing his testimony and adjusting their own to match it (though sequestration of subsequent witnesses is a preferable technique for solving this problem). Also, any trial proceedings <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not held in the presence of the jury</span> (e.g., discussions of the admissibility of evidence) probably may be closed to the public. <br/></p><p class="_M4Capt" id="11763"></a>iv.&#160;&#160;&#160; Limited seats&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_M4Text" id="11764"></a> Also, the right of access to public trials does not mean that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">every</span> person who desires to see a particular trial has a right to do so. Obviously, courtrooms have limited seating, and a trial judge may use a reasonable scheme of allocating seats. However, the First Amendment right recognized by <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Richmond Newspapers</span> probably does require that <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">at least some seats be given to media representatives</span>. <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="23145"></a>4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Less&#x2D;restrictive alternative required&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11772"></a> Although <span style="font-style:Italic;">Richmond Newspapers</span> established that there is a First Amendment right to access to criminal trials, <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">no</span> Justice suggested that that right is an <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">absolute</span> one. The test for determining when that right is outweighed by other countervailing interests has been developed in later cases. <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11773"></a>a.&#160;&#160;&#160; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Globe Newspapers&#x3A;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="11774"></a> In <span style="font-style:Italic;">Globe Newspapers v.

The closer regulation of broadcasters derives from the fact that broadcast frequencies are a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">naturally scarce</span> commodity &#x2014; whereas there can in theory be an unlimited number of newspapers serving any particular market, the technology of broadcasting is such that there could only be a strictly limited number of television and radio stations serving any particular market. (This distinction is, in practical terms, much less convincing in today&#x2019;s world of UHF and cable television, massive FM as well as AM radio, Internet video, etc., than it was when broadcasting was largely limited to VHF television and AM radio. But the Court has not fundamentally altered its willingness to tolerate closer regulation of the broadcast media.) <br/></p><p class="_L6Capt" id="11787"></a>1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Means of regulation&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L6Text" id="11788"></a> This regulation has generally been carried on through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Court has several times sustained the FCC&#x2019;s power to ensure various types of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">public access</span> to the broadcast media. See, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.

Similarly, the Court is probably more willing to tolerate closer regulation of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">context</span> where the source of speech is a broadcaster; see, e.g., <span style="font-style:Italic;"><a id="XREF_FCC_v__Pacifica_Foundation_cross-ref123" name="XREF_FCC_v__Pacifica_Foundation_cross-ref123" style="font-style:Italic;">FCC v.

The test set forth by the Court was that such restrictions impinging on broadcasters&#x2019; First Amendment rights will be upheld only if they are <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;narrowly tailored</span> to further a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial governmental interest</span>, such as ensuring adequate and balanced coverage of public issues. &#x2026; &#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_L8Capt" id="11793"></a>b.&#160;&#160;&#160; Test not satisfied&#x3A;<span style="font-weight:normal;"> <br/></span></p><p class="_L8Text" id="13128"></a> The Court concluded that the ban on editorializing could not survive this middle&#x2D;level review.

Coach, the team&#x2019;s head coach, after repeatedly telling Patti that she had been shooting too much and passing too little, benched Patti for most of the next three games. On the Sunday following the last benching, Patti, from her home, posted a TikToc video showing her shooting a basketball, with a text superimposed over it reading, &#x201c;Fuck Girls Basketball. I&#x2019;m sooo tired of being benched for ‘excess shooting,&#x2019; even though I&#x2019;m the best shooter on the team.&#x201d; The post was seen by two of Patti&#x2019;s teammates. Three hours after posting the video, Patti removed it, but by then one of the two teammates who saw it, Angela, had emailed a screenshot of it to Coach, together with a message from Angela saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really upset about this &#x2013; Patti&#x2019;s complaining is bad for team morale.&#x201d; The next school day, Coach criticized Patti for the post, and Patti immediately apologized.

Years ago, the A.G. promulgated a rule (&#x201c;Rule 1&#x30;&#x30;&#x201d;) requiring any charity that solicits more than &#x24;1&#x30;,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; in total donations in any year from West Carolina residents to report to the A.G. the names and addresses of any donor (whether residing in West Carolina or not) who has contributed more than &#x24;5,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; in that year.  Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; includes a promise by the A.G.&#x2019;s office that it will keep any reported information secret from the public. (However, several years ago, due to a clerical error in the office, the Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; donor reports from several charities were made publicly available on the office&#x2019;s website.) The administrative history of Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; shows that it was enacted so that if the A.G.&#x2019;s office ever had reason to suspect that a given charity was committing fraud in soliciting, that charity&#x2019;s up&#x2D;to&#x2D;date donor information would already be present in the A.G.&#x2019;s files, eliminating any need for the office to subpoena records from the charity at the start of an investigation. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="149740"></a>Toys for Kids, a Nevada&#x2D;based charity that raises about &#x24;1&#x30;&#x30;,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; per year from West Carolina residents, has sued the A.G.&#x2019;s office in federal court, claiming that Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; violates Toys&#x2019; (and its donors&#x2019;) First Amendment freedom of association. The charity argues that given the risk that the identities of its donors might be leaked by mistake (as happened previously), Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; cannot survive the relevant standard of review &#x2014; whatever that standard is &#x2014; because any interest the A.G.&#x2019;s office may have in combating fraudulent solicitations can be adequately served by the less&#x2D;intrusive alternative of issuing document subpoenas to a particular charity when and if the office has reason to suspect the charity of fraud. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="149741"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> What standard should the court use in determining whether Rule 1&#x30;&#x30;, as applied to Toys, violates Toys&#x2019; and its donors First Amendment freedom of association&#x3F; _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="149742"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> Using the standard you supplied in part (a), should the court find that Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; is unconstitutional as applied to Toys&#x3F; _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="149743"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(c) </span>For this part only, assume (whether the assumption is correct or not) that the court finds that Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; unconstitutionally violates Toys&#x2019; freedom of association.

Summers, a former football player turned sports announcer, was charged with the brutal murder of his wife. While in police custody, Summers gave a confession. In pretrial hearings, the trial judge determined that the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Miranda</span> rules had not been complied with, and decided that the confession would not be admissible at the trial. The press learned of the confession through pretrial proceedings in open court, and did not act improperly in obtaining this information. Prosecutors decided to try Summers as a principal in the murder, and also decided to charge B.C. Scowling, a long&#x2D;time friend of Summers, as an accomplice. Both trials were to be held simultaneously (but in front of separate juries) in proceedings conducted by Judge Jones. <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15658"></a>Judge Jones was very worried that disclosures about the confession might make it difficult or impossible to impanel a jury that would be fair to Summers. Therefore, several days before jury selection was to start, Jones issued two orders from the bench&#x3A; (1) he ordered that no newspaper, magazine or broadcaster report the existence or details of the inadmissible confession until after the jury had been picked (once the jury was picked, it could be sequestered, so that prejudicial disclosures would not matter anymore); (2) he also ordered that no lawyer on the case, including the lawyer for Scowling, disclose to the press or to anyone else the existence of Summers&#x2019; confession. (There was reason to believe that Scowlings&#x2019; lawyer planned to say in a public press conference, &#x201c;My client is innocent; P.J. confessed, and in his confession he said that he acted alone&#x201d;). <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15659"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a) </span>Is the judge&#x2019;s order in part (1) constitutional&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="15660"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> Is the judge&#x2019;s order in part (2) constitutional&#x3F;  _________________<br/></p><p class="_Q1" id="15664"></a>97. <br/></p><p class="_Q2" id="15665"></a>Roger is a reporter for the Hillsdale Star, a local newspaper.

One week after the killing, Roger published an article saying, &#x201c;A source that I cannot identify saw the crime from a distance, and believes that the perpetrator was a young white male about 22 years old, six feet tall, weighing about 175 pounds.&#x201d; In the ensuing months, the police have never been able to find this or any other witness to the crime. The prosecutor called Roger in front of a grand jury, and demanded that he identify the witness who served as his source. Roger stated under oath that the witness was fearful that the killer would kill her to silence her. Roger further stated that he had signed a written pledge to the witness that he would never reveal her name; only in response to this pledge did the witness agree to speak to him. Roger did say, however, that the witness lived in the neighborhood and that in his opinion, she could be identified by good police work. The judge then ordered Roger to disclose the witness&#x2019; identity, or be found in contempt of court. Roger refused. There is no state law relevant to the issue.

Valeo</span>, the Supreme Court has steadily broadened the types of limits that it has found to be unconstitutional restrictions on free speech. (The Court has consistently held that campaign spending is a form of speech, and is thus protected by the First Amendment, so that significant restrictions on such spending must survive strict scrutiny.)<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="91203"></a>As to [1], <span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span> held that the interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption (the <span style="font-style:Italic;">only</span> interest the Court has ever found to justify limits on campaign financing) justifies some limitations on donations by a single donor to a single candidate. The &#x24;5,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; limit here nearly matches the &#x24;5,2&#x30;&#x30; per year federal&#x2D;election donation limit in existence in 2&#x30;14, the year when the Court made its decision in <span style="font-style:Italic;">McCutcheon v. FEC</span> on the related issue of &#x201c;aggregate&#x201d; donation limits. Since the Court has not so far struck down the federal limits, the &#x24;5,&#x30;&#x30;&#x30; limit presumably remains a valid means of achieving the compelling governmental interest in combating corruption and its appearance. (But the Court&#x2019;s tendency to strike an ever&#x2D;broadening array of campaign&#x2D;finance limits suggests that even this right to limit single donor&#x2D;donee contributions may not remain in force indefinitely.)<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="91151"></a>[2] is clearly unconstitutional, under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span> itself &#x2014; the Court there held that limits on the amount that a candidate may spend from his own personal funds in order to get elected cannot be justified on the grounds that they serve the interest in avoiding corruption (since a candidate would not bribe himself). And the government&#x2019;s asserted interest in &#x201c;leveling the playing field&#x201d; (equalizing the resources of competing candidates) has been expressly rejected by the Court as an interest that can justify limits on campaign spending.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="91152"></a>[3] is also clearly unconstitutional, under the 2&#x30;14 decision in <span style="font-style:Italic;">McCutcheon v. FEC</span>. That decision rejected federal &#x201c;aggregate&#x201d; donation limits, which prevented any donor from giving more than &#x24;48,6&#x30;&#x30; to all federal candidates collectively (as well as from giving more than &#x24;74,6&#x30;&#x30; to all non&#x2D;candidate political committees collectively). The <span style="font-style:Italic;">McCutcheon</span> Court found that any limits on aggregate donations are not necessary to serve the anti&#x2D;corruption interest (repeatedly held by the Court to be the only interest which may support campaign&#x2D;finance limits); therefore, the comparable state limit in [3] would undoubtedly also be struck down by the Court.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="91153"></a>[4] is, too, clearly unconstitutional, and would have been so ever since the 1976 <span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span> decision. The Court held in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Buckley</span> that where a person makes campaign&#x2D;related expenditures <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">independently</span> of the candidate, there is no serious danger of a &#x201c;quid pro quo,&#x201d; so that the government&#x2019;s interest in avoiding even the appearance of corruption is not significantly implicated. Therefore, a person (as well as a corporation &#x2014; see <span style="font-style:Italic;">Citizens United</span> <span style="font-style:Italic;">v. FEC</span> (2&#x30;1&#x30;)) may spend unlimited funds urging the election or defeat of any candidate in any election, as long as the spender acts completely independently of any candidate. <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="136606"></a>91.<br/></p><p class="_R2" id="136654"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a) An &#x201c;exacting scrutiny&#x201d; standard, by which the agency fee scheme will be struck down unless it &#x201c;serves a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.&#x201d; </span>That&#x2019;s the standard the Supreme Court articulated for exactly this type of mandatory agency fee statute, in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Janus v.

The same would be true of the statute here. Therefore, the court must conclude that the Unionville statute violates the free expression rights of Pete and all other public employees who choose not to join the union. <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="150012"></a>92.<br/></p><p class="_R2" id="150013"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, because the Board of Ed&#x2019;s interest in regulating Patti&#x2019;s off&#x2D;campus speech was weaker than had the speech taken place either on campus or during a team event, and that interest was outweighed by Patti&#x2019;s First Amendment right to criticize the way in which a school activity is conducted. </span>The facts here are quite similar to those in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L. </span>(2&#x30;21), where the Court found that the one&#x2D;year&#x2D;long suspension of a student (P) from the school&#x2019;s cheerleading squad for making a similar social&#x2D;media post while off&#x2D;campus violated P&#x2019;s freedom of expression. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mahanoy</span> establishes that a school has a legitimate interest in regulating off&#x2D;campus student speech that concerns school activities, but that this interest is <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">relatively weak</span> in an off&#x2D;campus&#x2D;speech scenario like this one, because (1) the school is not acting &#x201c;<span style="font-style:Italic;">in loco parentis</span>&#x201d; (as it would if the speech occurred either on&#x2D;campus or during an off&#x2D;campus school activity itself); (2) if the school were allowed to tightly regulate such off&#x2D;campus speech in addition to on&#x2D;campus speech, every student&#x2019;s right to speak would be impaired for all 24 hours of the day; and (3) a school must &#x201c;protect unpopular ideas,&#x201d; because public schools are the &#x201c;nurseries of democracy.&#x201d; <br/></p><p class="_Q3" id="150014"></a>Here, the two interests that the Board of Ed claims to have been pursuing are relatively weak (as they were in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mahanoy</span>). As to the interest in avoiding &#x201c;vulgar or lewd language&#x201d; in connection with a school activity, the facts stipulate that the school district did not present any evidence that it has <span style="font-style:Italic;">generally</span> attempted to police the politeness of off&#x2D;campus speech about school activities; this matters, because a similar lack of evidence caused the <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mahanoy</span> Court to view the school&#x2019;s interest in civility there as relatively weak. As to the school&#x2019;s interest in avoiding disruption of school activities, the fact that the only evidence of disruption in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mahanoy</span> consisted of a few minutes in which a couple of P&#x2019;s teammates told teachers that they were &#x201c;upset&#x201d; by P&#x2019;s posts led the Court to view any disruption that occurred as minor; the same conclusion is appropriate here, where the only evidence of disruption was an email from one student (Angela), saying without elaboration that she was upset. Therefore, given that the judge is required to follow <span style="font-style:Italic;">Mahonoy</span> (the Court&#x2019;s only modern decision on when schools may regulate off&#x2D;campus speech relating to school activities), the judge should find that any interest in regulation held by the Board of Ed was outweighed by Patti&#x2019;s First Amendment right to comment freely and publicly on school activities. <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16038"></a>93. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="16039"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> One may not be required to state in a loyalty oath that one has not performed a certain act (or that one will not perform it in the future) unless <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">actual performance</span> of that act would be grounds for discharge. One may not be discharged for membership in an organization advocating overthrow of the government or other illegality, unless one has <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">knowledge</span> of the organization&#x2019;s purpose and <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">specific intent</span> to further that purpose. Consequently, one may not be required to swear a blanket oath that one has not been a member of such an organization &#x2014; language referring to the swearer&#x2019;s knowledge of the illegal purposes, and to her specific intent to further them, must be inserted into the oath. Since the oath here does not refer to Ramona&#x2019;s specific intent to use force to alter the Puerto Rican government, she cannot be penalized for refusing to sign it. See <span style="font-style:Italic;">Cole v. Richardson</span>.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16045"></a>94. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="16046"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, probably.</span> When government attempts to deny a public job or benefit because of a person&#x2019;s speech&#x2D; related activities, the level of judicial review depends on whether the speech related to matters of <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;public concern</span>.<span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201d;</span> If the speech did relate to matters of &#x201c;public concern,&#x201d; then the Court gives something like strict scrutiny to the situation, striking a balance between the free speech rights of the employee and the state&#x2019;s interest as an employer in conducting its activities efficiently. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Connick v. Myers.</span> Here, the speech is clearly relating to a matter of public concern, i.e., whether the head of the department took a bribe. Since Sheryl was engaging in core political speech, her interest in being allowed to do so was a strong one. On the other side of the equation, Sheryl was a low&#x2D;level clerk, not a policy&#x2D;making official; therefore, her speech was unlikely to have created a severe additional threat to the department&#x2019;s efficiency, especially since other people inside and outside the department were undoubtedly discussing the same much&#x2D;publicized issue anyway. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Rankin v. McPherson</span>. Consequently, a court would probably conclude that Sheryl&#x2019;s free speech interest outweighed the department&#x2019;s interest in maintaining smooth operations; if so, the court should order Sheryl reinstated. <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="37283"></a>By the way, it makes a difference that here, Sheryl&#x2019;s statement was <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">not required as part of her job duties.</span> <span style="font-style:Italic;">Garcetti v. Ceballos</span> establishes that where an employee speaks as part of her official duties, what she says <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">gets no First Amendment protection at all.</span> So if, say, Sheryl&#x2019;s official duties had included the obligation to make a report about any conflicts&#x2D;of&#x2D;interest she observed on the job, her statement, &#x201c;Horace took money from Computer Systems in violation of our Department&#x2019;s conflict&#x2D;of&#x2D;interest rules,&#x201d; made in her officially&#x2D;required report, would not get First Amendment protection, and Sheryl would now not be entitled to reinstatement. So it&#x2019;s only because Sheryl was speaking &#x201c;as a citizen&#x201d; (not as an employee) to her co&#x2D;worker that she gets protection under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Connick v. Myers</span>.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="37284"></a>Lastly, observe that because Sheryl was an at&#x2D;will employee, she could be fired at any time for &#x201c;no reason&#x201d;; even so, under <span style="font-style:Italic;">Connick</span> she had a First Amendment right not to be fired for the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">particular</span> reason that she was exercising her free speech rights.<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="149710"></a>95.<br/></p><p class="_R2" id="149833"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a) The &#x201c;exacting scrutiny&#x201d; standard, by which the disclosure requirement must be </span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"><a id="index_153933" name="index_153933"></a><a data-indexterm="NARROW%20TAILORING:Compulsory%20disclosure%20of%20association’s%20members%20as%20requiring" id="NARROW_TAILORING_Compulsory_disclosure_of_association’s_members_as_requiring" name="NARROW_TAILORING_Compulsory_disclosure_of_association’s_members_as_requiring"></a></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">&#x201c;narrowly tailored&#x201d; to the achievement of a &#x201c;sufficiently important governmental interest.&#x201d; </span>The Supreme Court articulated this standard in a case involving a California disclosure requirement very similar to the one here; see <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;font-size : 11.50pt;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity Foundation v Bonta</span> (2&#x30;21).<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="149834"></a>(b) <span style="font-weight:Bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, the court should find that Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; unconstitutionally violates the free association rights of Toys and its donors. </span>The <span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity</span> case, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, involved a California requirement that charities raising more than a certain total annual amount from California residents file with the state A.G.&#x2019;s office a copy of the charity&#x2019;s federal IRS filing (&#x201c;Form 99&#x30;&#x201d;) listing the identity of significant donors. The California rule was obviously similar to Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; here. The Court in <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity</span> concluded that (1) there was a significant risk that the public would learn the identity of donors appearing on the Form 99&#x30; (as the A.G.&#x2019;s office had inadvertently allowed to happen in the past); (2) members of the public might therefore harass the charity and its donors based on the leaked information; and (3) the disclosure requirement was not &#x201c;narrowly tailored&#x201d; to achieving the state&#x2019;s concededly&#x2D;important goal of reducing fraudulent solicitations, because the A.G.&#x2019;s office  could have used the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">less&#x2D;burdensome alternative</span> of waiting until it had reason to suspect a particular charity of fraud, and then subpoenaing the Form 99&#x30; from the charity. That same reasoning applies here, since West Carolina (like California in <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity</span>) could have achieved its anti&#x2D;fraud objective by using the less&#x2D;burdensome method of waiting until it had suspicions about a particular charity and then subpoenaing  the donor records from the charity.<br/></p><p class="_R3" id="149836"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(c) Yes, the court should find Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; unconstitutional &#x201c;on its face.&#x201d; </span>This is exactly what the Supreme Court did as to the California disclosure requirement struck down in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity</span>, <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>. In the First Amendment area, the <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;overbreadth&#x201d;</span> doctrine makes it especially easy for a court to find a law to be invalid on its face&#x3A; the law will be struck down as overly broad &#x201c;if a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">substantial number</span> of its <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">applications</span> are unconstitutional, judged in <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">relation to the statute&#x2019;s plainly legitimate sweep</span>.&#x201d; <span style="font-style:Italic;">Id</span>. The Court in <span style="font-style:Italic;">Americans for Prosperity</span> decided that in First Amendment cases in which the law (such as the disclosure requirement there) fails the relevant &#x201c;exacting scrutiny&#x201d; test, then even the mere <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;theoretical risk&#x201d;</span> that the law will have a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;chilling effect&#x201d; </span>on the freedom of association will compel the court to rule that the law is overbroad and thus invalid on its face. The same conclusion is required on our facts, since (as described in Part (b)) Rule 1&#x30;&#x30; fails &#x201c;exacting scrutiny,&#x201d; and will thus be deemed to have a chilling effect on the freedom of association of donors to any charity covered by the Rule, including charities not before the court.<br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16052"></a>96. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="16053"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">No.</span> &#x201c;Gag orders&#x201d; &#x2014; that is, pretrial orders prohibiting the press from publishing certain types of information about the case &#x2014; are virtually never constitutionally permissible. See <span style="font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-style:Italic;">Nebraska Press Ass&#x2019;n v. Stuart</span>. A gag order is a species of prior restraint, so it can be allowed only if its benefits substantially outweigh its First Amendment dangers, something that will virtually never happen. Here, there are other methods available to the judge to help assure a fair trial (e.g., careful <span style="font-style:Italic;">voir dire</span> to make sure that each juror has either not heard about the confession or understands that it is to be absolutely disregarded). (A gag order might be allowed if the press had <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">illegally</span> gotten the information, e.g., by bribing a member of the police department to release sealed information; but where the press comes by the information legally, a gag order preventing it from disseminating the material will almost never be upheld.)  <br/></p><p class="_R3" id="16054"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes, probably.</span> States may prevent a lawyer from making any statement that would have a <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;"></span><span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">&#x201c;substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing&#x201d;</span> an adjudicative proceeding. <span style="font-style:Italic;">Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada</span>. The state must give guidelines that are reasonably specific about what kinds of disclosures are and are not allowed. The ban here, which refers specifically to the facts of the confession, seems to have adequate specificity. While some sorts of gag orders might unconstitutionally restrict a defense lawyer&#x2019;s right to defend his client in the public eye (e.g., the states probably can&#x2019;t prevent a lawyer from asserting that his client is innocent, or from generally describing the client&#x2019;s proposed defense), references to a co&#x2D;defendant&#x2019;s inadmissible confession are probably the sort of unduly prejudicial remarks that a lawyer falling within the court&#x2019;s jurisdiction may be barred from making.  <br/></p><p class="_R1" id="16060"></a>97. <br/></p><p class="_R2" id="16061"></a><span style="font-weight:Bold;">Yes.</span> The First Amendment is not violated when a reporter is required to testify before a grand jury concerning information obtained from confidential sources during newsgathering.

The other two (Ginsburg and Breyer, both concurring only in the result) would have applied a less rigorous standard (though they didn&#x2019;t say what it was), making five Justices to hold the ban constitutional. But the four dissenters (Scalia, Kennedy, Alito and Thomas) all believed that strict scrutiny was required, and that the ban could <span style="font-style:Italic;">not</span> survive that strict scrutiny. So one majority of the Court &#x2014; Roberts plus the four dissenters &#x2014; believed that strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard, but a different majority (Roberts, plus two others who joined his reasoning, and another two who concurred only in result) believed that the ban could survive whatever scrutiny that particular Justice thought was the right standard. (But only one Justice, Roberts, simultaneously thought <span style="font-style:Italic;">both</span> that the standard to use was strict scrutiny and that the statute could survive.)<br/></p><p class="Footnote" id="143048"><a id="Ch14__FNH_14" name="Ch14__FNH_14"></a><a  href="#Ch14__FNB_14">14.</a></a>Because B.L. was a minor when the case began, the Supreme Court&#x2019;s opinion refers to her only by her initials.<br/></p><p class="Footnote" id="66512"><a id="Ch14__FNH_15" name="Ch14__FNH_15"></a><a  href="#Ch14__FNB_15">15.</a></a>Note that here, we&#x2019;re not talking about the situation in which government selects agents to disseminate what the public will realize is government&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:Italic;">own</span> message (a topic we discussed <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>); we&#x2019;re talking about the situation in which government gives funding to private speakers (or gives them access to public property, even non&#x2D;public&#x2D;forum public property, see Par. 6(b) <span style="font-style:Italic;">supra</span>, p. <a  href="#XREF_26157_123">537</a>), and in effect decrees, &#x201c;Say whatever you want, but you can&#x2019;t use this funding to deliver Message X or to speak on Subject X.&#x201d;<br/></p><p class="Footnote" id="100881"><a id="Ch14__FNH_16" name="Ch14__FNH_16"></a><a  href="#Ch14__FNB_16">16.</a></a>Notice that Thomas, who customarily votes with the conservative bloc on the Court, joined the four&#x2D;member liberal bloc on this case.
