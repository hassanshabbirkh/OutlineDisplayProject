            When government &ldquo;abridges&rdquo; freedom of speech, its reasons for doing so can be placed into two broad classes. The first is that the government is restricting the speech
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                because of its content
            </span>

                ideas or information contained in it
            </span>
            , or because of its general subject matter. The second reason for abridgment has nothing to do with the content of the speech; rather, the government seeks to avoid
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>

            The Supreme Court has implicitly recognized that the dangers posed by governmental action taken for the first reason are different (and generally more severe) than those posed by regulation carried out for the second reason. Therefore, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s rules for determining whether the government has violated the First Amendment differ depending on whether the governmental control falls within the first class or the second.

                Under Maryland tort law, if a speaker (D) intentionally makes outrageous statements attacking another person (P), P may be able to recover against D for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). In a federal-court diversity case based on Maryland tort law, a jury grants P (the father of a Marine killed in Iraq) a civil judgment for IIED against the Ds, who are members of a church that thinks God punishes the U.S. military for tolerating homosexuality. The IIED consists of the Ds having carried, during and nearby the Marine&rsquo;s funeral, picket signs attributing the Marine&rsquo;s death to God&rsquo;s desire to punish the military for not rooting out homosexuality.

            </strong>
            The most obvious type of scenario in which a restriction will be found to be &ldquo;content-based&rdquo; (and thus subjected to strict scrutiny) is one in which government has singled out a certain
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;message&rdquo;
            </span>
            or
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;viewpoint,&rdquo;
            </span>
            and imposes
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                restrictions on that message or viewpoint on account of its communicative content.
            </span>
            We&rsquo;ll refer to such restrictions as being
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;viewpoint based.&rdquo;

                i. Time, place and manner restrictions that are viewpoint based:
            </strong>
            Government rarely attempts to prohibit specific messages
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                entirely
            </span>
            ; rather, when government imposes &ldquo;viewpoint based&rdquo; restrictions, it typically does so by
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                limiting the time, place or manner
            </span>
            in which the message can be delivered. But even modest time, place and manner restrictions will
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                trigger strict scrutiny
            </span>
            if the restriction is &ldquo;viewpoint based,&rdquo; i.e., if it applies only to certain messages or viewpoints.

                struck down
            </span>
            the &ldquo;immoral or scandalous&rdquo; provision. The majority opinion by Justice Kagan consulted the dictionary definitions of &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; and &ldquo;scandalous,&rdquo; and found that both terms had
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                meanings tied to concepts of morality.
            </span>
            Therefore, Kagan said, the statute &ldquo;distinguishes between two
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                opposed sets of ideas
            </span>

                aligned with conventional moral standards

        <p class="_M4TextSub2dPar" id="141662">
            The statute&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;immoral and scandalous&rdquo; therefore constituted, on its face, viewpoint bias, triggering strict scrutiny. And the provision could not survive that scrutiny.

                istinctions based on viewpoint versus ones based on &ldquo;topic&rdquo;:
            </strong>
            Probably the greatest danger of content-based restrictions on speech is that government will
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                favor certain messages over others,
            </span>
            and will thereby
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                censor private expression.
            </span>
            That&rsquo;s why the Supreme Court has long interpreted the First Amendment as requiring strict scrutiny of such restrictions. All of the examples we&rsquo;ve considered so far of content-based restrictions are ones in which it&rsquo;s clear that the government was singling out speech
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                based on the particular viewpoint or message it contained.
            </span>
            But there&rsquo;s
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                another
            </span>
            type of content-based regulation, one that does not single out particular viewpoints. This consists of restrictions based on what can loosely be called the speech&rsquo;s
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;topic&rdquo;
            </span>
            or
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;subject matter.&rdquo;
            </span>
            And this type of regulation, too, will be subjected to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                strict scrutiny
            </span>
            , and probably struck down as a a First Amendment violation.

            </strong>
            The plaintiffs were the Good News Community Church and its pastor. Because the Church was cash-strapped, it wanted to publicize its services cheaply; posting signs around town was the main way it chose. The Church and the pastor sued the Town, arguing that the ordinance violated their rights of free speech by allowing them to keep their signs up for a far shorter time each week than if the sign had been an &ldquo;Ideological&rdquo; one.

            <strong>
                iii. Court strikes the statute in opinion by Thomas:
            </strong>
            All nine Justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the statute
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment rights.
            </span>
            For our present discussion of content-neutrality, what&rsquo;s most significant is that all nine Justices agreed that the ordinance was
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                content-based,
            </span>
            even though it did

                not
            </span>

            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                suppress any particular message.
            </span>
            Therefore, all Justices agreed, it had to be
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                strictly scrutinized
            </span>
            , and invalidated. We&rsquo;ll focus on Justice Thomas&rsquo; opinion, in which he announced the result and gave a rationale that five other Justices supported.

                Strict scrutiny is triggered:
            </strong>
            The ordinance was clearly content-based, due to its
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                on-its-face classification based on subject matter and purpose.
            </span>
            Therefore, Thomas said, the Court was required to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                subject it to strict scrutiny.
            </span>
            Thus the Town bore the burden of demonstrating that the Code&rsquo;s differentiation between Temporary Directional Signs and other types of signs, such as Ideological Signs, &ldquo;

                Easy to strike down:
            </strong>
            In Thomas&rsquo; view (which on this point was shared by all Justices), the Town had
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                not
            </span>
            come even remotely close to satisfying this very difficult burden. The Town had cited only two governmental interests in support of the distinction: preserving the town&rsquo;s
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                aesthetic appeal
            </span>
            , and
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                maintaining traffic safety
            </span>
            . Even if these were compelling interests (which Thomas assumed but did not decide), the distinctions used in the code were &ldquo;hopelessly
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                underinclusive.&rdquo;

        </p>
        <p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="99677" style="margin-top : 3.00pt;">
            For instance, the Town &ldquo;cannot claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                necessary to beautify

                iv. Concurrence only in result:
            </strong>
            But three members of the Court disagreed with parts of Thomas&rsquo; reasoning, and therefore concurred only in the result. Justice Kagan (joined by Ginsburg and Breyer) agreed with Thomas that the Court does, and should continue to, apply strict scrutiny to facially content-based regulations of speech &ldquo;when there is any
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &lsquo;realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.&rsquo; &rdquo;
            </span>
            And she agreed that, because there is such a possibility of suppression when the regulation on its face differentiates &ldquo;on the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                basis of viewpoint,&rdquo;
            </span>
            or restricts &ldquo;discussion of an
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                entire topic&rdquo;
            </span>
            in public debate, strict scrutiny is needed in
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                those
            </span>
            instances. But, she said, in cases where hidden official suppression of ideas
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                is &ldquo;not realistically possible,&rdquo;
            </span>
            the Court should perhaps

            </strong>
            Kagan agreed that the present statute was not one of those cases where hidden official suppression was &ldquo;not realistically possible&rdquo;; that&rsquo;s why she concurred in the result. But Kagan gave several examples of categories of signs that, under the majority&rsquo;s standard, could not be given any preference without being struck down, but that she thought might be constitutionally permissible. For instance, according to the majority&rsquo;s analysis a town could not give preference for signs informing passersby
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;where George Washington slept,&rdquo;
            </span>
            unless the town could show a compelling interest in doing so. Kagan predicted that courts across the U.S. would now have to invalidate the &ldquo;entirely reasonable&rdquo; sign restrictions of
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                thousands of towns.

                buffer zone

                anti-abortion protesters
            </span>
            against women visiting the clinic. Does the fact that the zone on its face excludes

                everyone, regardless of message,
            </span>

                most effectively be communicated

            &mdash; is not content-based.&rdquo; Scalia went on, &ldquo;Would the Court exempt from strict scrutiny a law banning access to the streets and sidewalks surrounding the site of the Republican National Convention? Or those used annually to commemorate the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches? ... Surely not.&rdquo;

                A court might hold that panhandling on the street has so little expressive content that it gets no First Amendment protection at all. The court might reason that the express or implied statement &ldquo;Please give me money&rdquo; (or even &ldquo;Please give me money because I&rsquo;m poor&rdquo;) does not really convey any communicative element that would be so understood by the people to whom it is addressed.

            Yet, certain types of political speech may seem to most of us to pose a threat to the very system of representative democracy which freedom of speech is supposed to ensure. For instance, speech calling for immediate assassination of the President, or the institution of a military coup, seems dangerous to tolerate. However, once the government is permitted to prevent or punish some types of political speech, there arises the threat that those in power may also

            Since early 20th century, when the Supreme Court first began its serious grappling with the limits of valid political speech, the Court has generally tried to distinguish between, on the one hand, general
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                political dissent

            (which constitutes an &ldquo;unprotected category,&rdquo; and may therefore be punished). But the Court has vacillated dramatically during this period in drawing the line between these two types of speech. Most commentators agree that the current standard, articulated in 1969 in

            , American socialists of Russian-Jewish birth, were convicted of violating a newly-added section of the Espionage Act, which prohibited the urging of any curtailment of war production with intent to hinder the United States&rsquo; prosecution of the War. The defendants had published two pro-Bolshevik leaflets, which attacked the United States&rsquo; production and supplying of arms that might be used against Russia (against whom the U.S. had not declared war); neither leaflet was pro-German, and in fact one was violently against German militarism. The leaflets urged workers not to make bullets which would be used not only against Germans but Russians as well.

            The key factual issue in the case was whether the defendants had the requisite intent to interfere with the war effort

                against Germany

            .&rdquo; Curtailment of production to protect Russians could not have been accomplished except by also impairing the war effort against Germany, the majority believed, so that the intent requirement was satisfied. (The majority also went out of its way to emphasize, repeatedly, that the defendants were self-proclaimed &ldquo;anarchists.&rdquo;)

                </span>
            </strong>
            First, at least as it was applied in early cases, the doctrine obviously did not give very much protection to freedom of speech, since the defendants in

                Schenck, Frohwerk, Debs

            </strong>
            Second, the test, since it relies upon the fact-finder&rsquo;s opinion about the immediacy of a specific threat (e.g., obstruction of military recruitment), makes political speech particularly vulnerable to the mass hysteria which tends to strike in times of national crisis. For instance, the test gave the least protection to speech during the First World War and during the McCarthy anti-Communist scare, as discussed below.

                upheld

The plaintiffs were various American citizens and organizations that wanted to train members of these groups in how to use international law to resolve their disputes peacefully, and also wanted to engage in political advocacy on their behalf.

There was no constitutional difficulty, Roberts said, with prohibiting material support of an illegal organization (at least a foreign one), even if the supporter did not have a specific intent to further the organization&rsquo;s illegal aims.

            Because of the especially great importance of freedom of expression in our constitutional scheme, the Supreme Court has developed several techniques of statutory analysis to make sure that that freedom gets the extra protection it requires. One of these techniques is the use of the doctrine of

            There are two respects in which the doctrine of statutory overbreadth changes the usual rules of constitutional litigation:

                </span>
            </strong>
            First, a litigant who is attempting to have a statute ruled unconstitutional must normally show that it is unconstitutional
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                in its application to him.
            </span>
            For instance, in a First Amendment case that does not involve overbreadth, the challenger to a statute must show that his own speech or conduct was protected by the First Amendment. But the overbreadth doctrine permits the challenger to prevail if he can show that the statute, applied according to its terms, would violate the First Amendment rights of persons not now before the Court. Thus overbreadth can be viewed as an
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </strong>
            In fact, where overbreadth analysis is applied, the Court simply
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                assumes
            </span>
            that a more narrowly-drawn statute

                could
            </span>
            constitutionally proscribe the challenger&rsquo;s own conduct. Ordinarily, the Court never even decides this question explicitly; by deciding to apply overbreadth analysis, it is able to decide instead the usually
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                easier
            </span>

            Secondly, in the usual situation, where a court finds a statute to be unconstitutional it will simply

                leaving the statute in force
            </span>
            as to those situations where its application would be constitutional. But where overbreadth is applied, the statute is

            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                completely struck down

            Until a different statute is enacted (a more limited one, applying only where it may constitutionally do so), or until another court with authority construes the statute more narrowly (in a way that forbids only constitutionally-proscribable speech or conduct), the statute is simply unenforceable against

            </strong>
            &sect;818 of Oklahoma&rsquo;s Merit System Act prohibited civil servants from engaging in certain political activities, including taking part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign, and soliciting for campaign contributions. Broadrick, who had campaigned for a superior and had solicited money for him, challenged &sect;818 on overbreadth (as well as vagueness) grounds. He pointed out that &sect;818 had been construed as applying to such political expression as the wearing of political buttons and the displaying of bumper stickers, which (he asserted) were constitutionally-protected free speech activities. Therefore, he contended, the section must be struck down, regardless of whether his own activity could have been constitutionally proscribed by a more narrowly-drawn statute.

            The opinion distinguished between statutes primarily regulating conduct and those directly governing speech. In situations involving the latter, the Court did not modify the overbreadth rule. But in the case of statutes

            , where the conduct happens to have an expressive content, the &ldquo;strong medicine&rdquo; of complete invalidation of the statute should not invariably be applied. Instead, the majority believed, for facial invalidation to be appropriate, &ldquo;the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but

                substantial

That is, a case that would be a difficult one if it had to be decided on its own facts often becomes easy once the statute can be taken literally and applied to a substantial number of other hypothetical situations, as to which it would clearly be unconstitutional.

                </span>

            Theoretically, the proscription against vagueness stems from the Due Process Clause&rsquo;s requirement that people be given

                fair notice

            of what conduct is prohibited. But many void-for-vagueness holdings stem more from violations of other constitutional provisions, particularly the First Amendment. In the First Amendment area, an unduly vague statute has the same

But since by its terms it appears to apply to constitutionally-protected conduct, and since there is no &ldquo;bright line&rdquo; rule to separate out the constitutional from unconstitutional applications, neither a member of the public nor a court has an easy way to articulate what the statute may constitutionally cover.

They carried signs saying, &ldquo;Reinstate Xavier&rdquo;; they also chanted and sang. The Chancellor happened to be away from the office that day (unbeknownst to Darwin and his friends), and nobody in the building was considering Xavier&rsquo;s case at the time.

            The city of Munford has enacted the following ordinance: &ldquo;No person shall attempt to give to passersby on any sidewalk or public thoroughfare any handbill during a Restricted Time Period. &lsquo;Restricted Time Period&rsquo; shall mean the hours between 8:00 and 9:30 a.m. and the hours between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. &lsquo;Handbill&rsquo; is defined to include any piece of printed literature, four pages or less, dealing with a single topic.&rdquo; The purpose of the definition is to cover advertising circulars and brochures, but not to cover newspapers and magazines. The ordinance was enacted in response to two fears: (1) that during the busy rush hour, people were handing out so many handbills that the flow of pedestrian traffic was frequently impaired; and (2) that an extraordinary amount of litter was being generated when people who had handbills thrust into their hands dropped them on the sidewalk. Kermit, a political candidate who was giving out brochures in support of his own candidacy, was charged with violating the statute. Kermit now argues that a conviction would violate his First Amendment rights. Should the Court agree? _________________

            Picketers picket on the public street adjacent to the house of CEO, the head of a company that makes drones used in an unpopular foreign war. The signs they carry contain intentionally hurtful messages (e.g., &ldquo;CEO is a cowardly murderer&rdquo;). The state common law of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) allows recovery for any &ldquo;outrageous and intentionally offensive&rdquo; language carried on a picket sign near the plaintiff&rsquo;s house. In a suit brought by CEO against the picketers, a jury imposes a $100,000 civil judgment in favor of CEO. May the judgment be constitutionally imposed? _________________

            Leonard, a resident of a state that bordered Mexico, believed that the federal government should vastly increase the physical barriers to illegal immigration from Mexico. One day he went to a park that was frequented by people on both sides of the immigration issue. Before a moderately interested audience of about 20 people, all of whom had come to the park for other purposes, Leonard began to make a speech. He said, &ldquo;If the federal government doesn&rsquo;t start doing a whole lot more to keep out illegal immigrants, we&rsquo;ll have to make &rsquo;em do it. Let&rsquo;s start by building up an arsenal of automatics and machine guns. Eventually, we&rsquo;ll have guerilla cells throughout the Southwest to make the federal government&rsquo;s life such a hell they&rsquo;ll build the kind of huge border fence we need.&rdquo; A few of the listeners applauded, one asked a question, but no one took any other action in apparent response to Leonard&rsquo;s speech. Immediately after his speech, Leonard was arrested by the police for violating &sect;123 of a state statute. That statute provided that it is a felony to &ldquo;advocate insurrection against the state or federal government or any local subdivision thereof.&rdquo; Leonard now defends on the grounds that a conviction would violate his First Amendment rights. May Leonard constitutionally be convicted of violating the statute?  _________________

            Robert was a tenured teacher in a public high school, in the state of Cartesia. He was also a member of NAMBLA, the National Association of Man Boy Love Affairs. NAMBLA&rsquo;s charter says that it is dedicated to the furtherance of social and sexual interaction between men and boys. Cartesia makes it a crime for an adult male to have sexual relations with a boy under the age of 17. Robert knows the aims of NAMBLA, and supports those aims; in fact, he himself has in the recent past had sexual relations with a boy. School officials, worried about recent publicity concerning teachers who belong to NAMBLA, asked Robert and all other teachers at the school to sign an affidavit stating that &ldquo;I am not now nor have I ever been a member of NAMBLA.&rdquo; (The affidavit said nothing else.) School officials announced that if a teacher did not sign the affidavit, they would consider that refusal to sign presumptive evidence of unfitness to be a teacher. Robert has so far refused to sign the affidavit. He wishes to challenge the constitutionality of the school&rsquo;s insistence that he sign.

            Government may impose reasonable regulations on the &ldquo;time, place and manner&rdquo; of speech that takes place on public forums. However, government&rsquo;s right to do this is contingent on its behaving in a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                content-neutral
            </span>
            way. If government chooses to allow some messages and not allow others based on the content of the speech, then the restriction will be strictly scrutinized, and will be struck down unless it is: (1) necessary to achieve a compelling objective; and (2) narrowly drawn to achieve that objective. See, e.g.,
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                Widmar v. Vincent
            </span>

        </p>
        <p class="_R3" id="15813">
            Here, government allows messages that pertain to matters under discussion inside the office building, but not messages pertaining to other matters. The government might defend on the grounds that it has not objected to the content of the messages, but has merely allowed some whole &ldquo;categories&rdquo; of speech while not allowing other whole categories. However, even distinctions among topics or categories is typically found to be content-based. See, e.g.,
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                Consolidated Edison v. Public Serv. Comm.
            </span>
            (state may not prevent utilities from discussing the issue of nuclear power&rsquo;s desirability, because &ldquo;[t]he First Amendment&rsquo;s hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.&rdquo;) In any event, the speech here is taking place in a public forum, so the court will be especially reluctant to allow such a broad interference with it.

                Yes.

            First, we need to analyze whether the restriction is
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                content-based.
            </span>
            A regulation can be found to be content-based even though it does
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                not

                favor any point of view
            </span>
            over another. Thus in addition to regulations that favor certain messages or points of view, content-based regulations are defined so as to also include regulations that (a)
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                place a particular topic or subject matter off-limits

                more stringent time-place-and-manner restrictions

            than other topics or subject categories. [

            ] A court would almost certainly say that the restriction here falls within category (b), since publications are treated differently depending on whether they discuss only a single subject or multiple subjects. Therefore, the court will almost surely classify the restriction here as content-based.

            to restrict the distribution of free magazines and newspapers in the same places and time slots, even though that distribution poses essentially the same dangers. A dramatically underinclusive regulation will rarely be found to satisfy the very tight &ldquo;means-end fit&rdquo; requirement imposed by strict scrutiny. See, e.g.,

                Brandenburg v. Ohio
            </span>
            , speech advocating such illegality may only be proscribed if two conditions are satisfied: (1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                imminent

                likely

                imminent
            </span>
            illegality &mdash; he says &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start &hellip; ,&rdquo; but he does not indicate that action should take place immediately. Furthermore, although his statement about having guerilla cells could probably be interpreted as a call for illegality, his statement about &ldquo;building up an arsenal&rdquo; is not necessarily a call for illegality, since there are many legal ways to buy guns, even automatics and machine guns. Even if the court decides that Leonard was attempting to incite imminent lawless action, it is pretty clear that there was very little risk that his speech was

                likely
            </span>

Here, the affidavit merely requires Robert to say that he has not been a member; since Robert would be entitled to be a mere member of NAMBLA, so long as he did not agree with its aim of advocating imminent commission of the crime of man-boy love, the affidavit requirement would punish some membership that is constitutional.

Here, however, this requirement of substantial overbreadth is probably satisfied, since quite a number of people are likely to belong to NAMBLA just to get information about the law and politics surrounding this question rather than to advocate or practice illegal man-boy sex. Therefore, Robert&rsquo;s overbreadth attack will probably succeed.

            A statute will be held void for vagueness if the conduct forbidden by it is so unclearly defined that a person of ordinary intelligence would not know what is forbidden.

        <p class="_R3" id="15849" style="text-indent : 10.80pt;">
            Here, the statute uses the words &ldquo;lewd or lascivious,&rdquo; but furnishes no further information about what type of conduct is being forbidden. A reasonable observer would probably be in doubt as to whether it is necessarily lewd for a woman to appear topless. Because of the ordinance&rsquo;s lack of specificity, undue discretion is given to local law enforcement officials, who depending on how they felt about Becky or toplessness generally could decide to look the other way rather than making an arrest. Therefore, while the city might be entitled to ban women from appearing topless in public if the ordinance specifically applied to toplessness, the formulation here is probably unconstitutionally vague.

            for a law regulating expression to be &ldquo;narrowly tailored&rdquo; to the achievement of a state interest? The answer is that the law

                must not &ldquo;burden substantially more speech than is necessary

                a bit more speech

            P, as a 21-year-old college student, had sex with a 13-year-old-girl and was convicted of statutory rape. Eight years later, he logged into Facebook and posted a single message celebrating getting a traffic ticket dismissed. By virtue of this post alone, P was convicted of felony violation of the statute. He argued that the statute violated his freedom of expression, because it was not sufficiently narrowly-tailored to meet the state&rsquo;s goal of preventing sexual abuse of minors.

By forbidding residents from displaying virtually any &ldquo;sign&rdquo; on their property, the city &ldquo;has almost completely foreclosed a venerable means of communication that is both unique and important.&rdquo; The city has not &ldquo;[left] open ample alternative channels for communication. &hellip; Residential signs are an unusually cheap and convenient form of communication. Especially for persons of modest means or limited mobility, a yard or window sign may have no practical substitute.&rdquo; Therefore, even though the city&rsquo;s ordinance may be content-neutral, and even assuming that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, it unconstitutionally infringes P&rsquo;s free speech.

            </span>
            by the paraders. (Only if the content of the expression places it within an &ldquo;unprotected category,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;advocacy of imminent illegal activity,&rdquo; may this content be taken into account.)

            , the ordinance is an unconstitutional violation of freedom of speech. It gives a censor&rsquo;s power to the City Manager, since his right to deny a permit is not tied to the avoidance of littering or disorderly conduct, or to regulation of time and place. Because the ordinance is void on its face (for what would today be called overbreadth), D was not required to seek the permit and then challenge its denial in court; she was free to disregard the permit requirement and to challenge the ordinance after her arrest.

The government&rsquo;s interest in not having overlapping parades, and in having advance notice so as to be able to ensure proper policing, furnished adequate justification for the permit requirement.

            Similarly, the Court held that New York City could require that any musician performing in a public forum (the bandshell in Central Park) use city-provided sound-amplification equipment and sound technicians. The city had a significant governmental interest in protecting citizens from unduly loud sounds, and the regulation was not substantially broader than necessary to achieve that interest.

The statute meant that the Ps could not make such an approach to any woman within 35 feet of a clinic entrance, even if the woman being approached gave no indication that she would find the approach unwelcome.

            D, a left-wing college student, made a street-corner speech in which he called President Truman a &ldquo;bum&rdquo; and the American Legion a &ldquo;Nazi Gestapo,&rdquo; and said that blacks should &ldquo;rise up in arms and fight for [legal rights].&rdquo; One member of the racially-mixed crowd said that if the police did not get that &ldquo;son of a bitch&rdquo; off the stand he would do it himself. D refused to heed requests from the police to stop speaking, and was then arrested for disorderly conduct.

            But Justice Black dissented, disagreeing with the majority&rsquo;s view of both the facts and the law. As a factual matter, he did not agree that violence was imminent; he believed that D had in reality been arrested and convicted for the unpopularity of his views, not the tendency of his speech to induce violence. He also believed, as a legal principle, that the police must, before interfering with a lawful speaker, make &ldquo;

                Cohen&rsquo;s

                &ldquo;captive audiences&rdquo;
            </span>
            from offensive language. But Harlan&rsquo;s opinion took a narrow view of what constitutes a true &ldquo;captive audience.&rdquo; Those in the courthouse could have &ldquo;avoid[ed] further bombardment of their senses simply by

            Lastly, Harlan rejected the state&rsquo;s most general claim, that it had the right to ban certain expletives in order to &ldquo;maintain what [officials] regard as a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                suitable level of discourse

            Only where speech falls within relatively narrow pre-established categories may government regulate its form or content; none of these exceptions was applicable here.

                No stopping point:
            </strong>
            First, there was no principled way to distinguish &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; from other words. Yet the state clearly did not have the right to &ldquo;cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us.&rdquo; The preferable constitutional result was simply to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </span>

                </span>
            </strong>
            Secondly, this was not simply a situation in which Cohen chose vulgar words to express an idea that could have been equally well expressed by more polite language. The language chosen by Cohen, like much expression, conveyed not only an intellectual idea, but also
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>

            </span>
            The Constitution protects this

                &ldquo;emotive function&rdquo;
            </span>

            grew out of one such picketing session, in which the church members carried hateful signs on public land adjacent to the Maryland funeral of a Marine Lance Colonel killed in Iraq, Matthew Snyder. Matthew&rsquo;s father, Albert Snyder, saw the signs on a TV broadcast after the funeral and became severely distressed at their content. He brought a federal-court diversity action based on substantive Maryland law for the tort of IIED. He ultimately obtained a civil judgment for $4 million in combined compensatory and punitive damages against the church members. The issue was whether that &mdash; or indeed any &mdash; civil judgment could be enforced without violating the church members&rsquo; First Amendment rights. (The Supreme Court&rsquo;s answer turned out to be a very clear &ldquo;no,&rdquo; as we&rsquo;ll see.)

Some viewers seem to have assumed that the picketers were saying that Matthew was himself gay; in any event, Matthew was not in fact gay.

When the village learned of the Nazis&rsquo; demonstration plans, it passed an ordinance to ban the demonstration.

            Proponents of the ordinance argued that even if it was content-based, it could survive the strict scrutiny given to content-based regulations because it was necessary to serve a compelling state interest. Scalia conceded that the state had a compelling interest in safeguarding the rights of traditionally-disfavored groups, including their right to live in peace where they wish. But he argued that the ordinance was not
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;
            </span>

However, there was strong evidence that D had selected his victim, V, based on race; for instance, he pointed to V, told his friends, &ldquo;There goes a white boy; go get him,&rdquo; then led them in a severe beating of V.

                &ldquo;nude dancing&rdquo;

            case. The city of Erie, Pa. passed an ordinance that required live dancers to wear at least &ldquo;pasties&rdquo; and a &ldquo;G-string.&rdquo; (Neither the city nor anyone else claimed that nude dancing was obscene and therefore constitutionally unprotected.) The city said that it was attacking not the expressive content of nude live entertainment, but rather its secondary effects, such as violence, sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution, and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The ban applied throughout the city, not just in a delimited area (as a prior Supreme Court case had approved). A nightclub that presented live nude dancers attacked the ordinance.

            A brief summary of the Court&rsquo;s holdings is that the government has substantial latitude in regulating indecent expression on the

(Minors were defined as persons under 17.)  Web operators were given an affirmative defense if they screened minors from access by some

            Kennedy concluded that the government had not borne this burden of proof here. In particular, he focused on
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;blocking and filtering software&rdquo;
            </span>
            that could voluntarily be installed by users on their own computers. Such filtering software would clearly be less restrictive than the age-verification scheme required by COPA; for instance, an adult with children could simply turn off the filter when the adult wanted to use the computer. Therefore, the injunction should be permitted to stand while the case was tried on the merits, and the statute would be found valid only if the government could show (as seemed very unlikely) that the statute was in fact the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                least-restrictive available means of effectively blocking minors

Opponents of abortion frequently attempt to station themselves on public property near the entrances to clinics, so that the opponents can from there either engage in protest (e.g., by holding signs opposing abortion), or attempt to persuade prospective clients of the clinic that they should reconsider their plans.

                major portions of the Internet

                i. Status of &ldquo;cyberspace&rdquo;:
            </strong>
            In support of that conclusion, Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s majority opinion said that
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;a street or a park is a quintessential forum

                most important places

            (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear. It is

                ii. &ldquo;Internet social networking services&rdquo;:
            </strong>
            Kennedy then focused his analysis on &ldquo;Internet social networking services&rdquo; &mdash; the types of sites covered by the statute at issue. Kennedy found that this category included sites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, and said that &ldquo;social media users employ these websites to engage in a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                wide array of protected First Amendment activity
            </span>

            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &lsquo;as diverse as human thought.&rsquo;
            </span>
            &rdquo; Therefore, he said, the state&rsquo;s decision to place these social media websites off-limits to certain users (registered sex offenders) had to undergo mid-level review, which it could not survive.

            So it sounds as though a majority of the Court that decided

            believes that social media websites on the Internet &mdash; and perhaps other types of websites as well &mdash; are now such important avenues for First Amendment expression that even content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions on a person&rsquo;s access to such sites are to be analyzed by the same mid-level-review standard as are restrictions on expression occurring in true public forums like public streets and parks or in designated public forums (see Par.

            Observe that the major Internet social-media websites like Facebook are
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                privately-owned
            </span>

                Packingham

            seems to mean that the fact that a particular place for expression is privately owned does

                not

                &ldquo;no,&rdquo;

Suppose further that Facebook learns that P is such an offender, and cancels his user ID under the terms of service. Can P argue that First Amendment principles (or perhaps common-law &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; principles inspired by the First Amendment) prevent Facebook from imposing this restriction on him given that government wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to do so?

            It seems clear that P will

            with this argument. The fact that the restriction comes from a private person (the site owner) who is not acting at any government&rsquo;s request will itself suffice to deprive P of a First Amendment claim. And it&rsquo;s unlikely that the courts will recognize any sort of federal or state &ldquo;common-law right to free expression&rdquo; &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by First Amendment concerns.

                The University of California&rsquo;s Hastings College of Law gives official recognition and some funding only to those organizations (&ldquo;Registered Student Organizations,&rdquo; or RSOs) that comply with the school&rsquo;s nondiscrimination rules (the &ldquo;all-comers&rdquo; policy). The all-comers policy requires any RSO to accept all students who apply, and also forbids RSOs from discriminating on the basis of various specified criteria, one of which is sexual orientation. P (the Christian Legal Society) refuses to accept any student who engages in &ldquo;unrepentant homosexual conduct,&rdquo; or who holds religious convictions different from those contained in a &ldquo;Statement of Faith&rdquo; the Society has adopted. Hastings refuses to grant P the RSO status because of these limits on who may join. P claims that the all-comers policy violates the First Amendment requirement that when government restricts access to limited public forums (i.e., non-public forums) the restriction must be both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.

                Held
            </span>
            , for Hastings: the all-comers policy is constitutional. The policy is viewpoint neutral: &ldquo;[It is] hard to imagine a more viewpoint-neutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept all comers.&rdquo; The requirement that student groups accept all applicants is &ldquo;  &lsquo;justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.&rsquo;  &rdquo; (Also, the all-comers requirement is
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                reasonable
            </span>
            for several reasons, including that Hastings could reasonably conclude that (1) an equal-access policy promotes the educational experience, and (2) in light of the fact that RSOs get school funding, no Hastings student should be forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.)

Only religious groups [are] required to admit students who [do] not share their views.&rdquo;)

For instance, in a case in which a state-owned TV station organized a televised debate to which the two leading candidates for a congressional seat were invited, the court found that the forum was a nonpublic one, because the debate &ldquo;did not have an open-microphone format,&rdquo; i.e., the station did not make its debate &ldquo;generally available to candidates&rdquo; for that seat. Therefore, the station was within its rights not to invite plaintiff, a minor candidate (so long as the station made its decision based upon an objective determination of the plaintiff&rsquo;s lack of strength rather than upon lack of enthusiasm for his views).

                public property

                Stromberg v. California
            </span>
            , 283 U.S. 359 (1931), striking a statute prohibiting display of a red flag as a symbol of opposition to organized government). Yet the Court has been wary of giving generalized First Amendment protection to any act which is an attempt to convey a message; this reluctance stems principally from the fear that granting such protection would legitimatize actions like political assassinations, Patty Hearst-type bank robberies, pouring blood on draft records, and other violent actions.

                communicative content
            </span>

                strict scrutiny

Conversely, where the Court believes that the government&rsquo;s interest in regulating the conduct has nothing to do with the conduct&rsquo;s expressive content (&ldquo;track two&rdquo;), a more-easily-satisfied balancing test is applied, in which the interest being pursued by the state may well be found to outweigh the individual&rsquo;s interest in using that particular mode of expression.

            O&rsquo;Brien and several others burned their draft cards in public, as part of a protest against the war in Vietnam. They were convicted of violating an amendment to the draft laws making it a crime to &ldquo;knowingly destroy [or] mutilate&rdquo; a draft card.

                &ldquo;limited to the non-communicative aspect

This and the other governmental interests were &ldquo;important and substantial,&rdquo; and could not have been achieved with any less impact on O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s freedom of expression.

            in enacting the statute was the improper one of suppressing dissent. But the Court rejected this argument, concluding that

            Johnson, the defendant, participated in a political demonstration outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. At the end of the demonstration, he unfurled an American flag, doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire. While the flag burned, the protestors chanted, &ldquo;America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.&rdquo; Johnson was charged with violating the desecration statute; at his trial, several witnesses testified that they had been seriously offended by the flag burning, and he was convicted.

            By a 5-4 vote, the Court held that the Texas statute violated the First Amendment as applied to Johnson&rsquo;s acts. The majority opinion was written by Justice Brennan.

                </span>
            </strong>
            The key to the result reached by the majority was that the Court applied what we have called &ldquo;track one&rdquo; analysis. That is, the majority determined that the prosecution of Johnson was
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;directly related to expression.&rdquo;
            </span>
            In reaching this conclusion, the Court reviewed the two objectives that Texas asserted it was pursuing: (1) preventing breaches of the peace; and (2) preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. As to objective (1), the majority simply disbelieved that preventing breaches of the peace was what had motivated Texas on these facts (since no disturbance of the peace either actually occurred or was threatened by this particular flag burning). As to objective (2), the need to protect the flag as a symbol of national unity would only be implicated if the defendant&rsquo;s conduct had a contrary message associated with it, so this objective was &ldquo;directly related to expression&rdquo; and thus called for track one scrutiny. The content-based nature of the statute was illustrated by the fact that particular conduct was covered only if an observer&rsquo;s likely reaction would be to be &ldquo;seriously offended&rdquo; &mdash; the offense could only flow from the message accompanying the act. (For instance, if D had burned the flag as a means of respectfully disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he would not have offended anyone, and he would not have been convicted under the statute.)

            </strong>
            Since Johnson was prosecuted only because of the content of the particular message he was conveying, the Court applied strict scrutiny to the statute. &ldquo;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.&rdquo; Here, Texas&rsquo;s objective &mdash; preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity &mdash; may have been worthy, even &ldquo;compelling.&rdquo; But the means chosen by Texas to serve that objective were not necessary ones. First, the majority didn&rsquo;t believe that the nation&rsquo;s belief in the cherished significance of the flag would be undermined by acts of mutilation; indeed, these acts might produce the opposite result. Second, the government could combat such acts by acts of its own, such as giving the remains of the flag a respectful burial (as one witness to Johnson&rsquo;s burning did).

            </strong>
            Four members of the Court bitterly dissented. The principal dissent was by Justice Rehnquist (joined by White and O&rsquo;Connor). The dissenters thought that a state could prohibit the burning of a flag without violating the First Amendment prohibition on suppression of ideas. &ldquo;The flag is not simply another &lsquo;idea&rsquo; or &lsquo;point of view&rsquo; competing for recognition in the market place of ideas.&rdquo; Also, the dissenters thought that flag burning is so inherently inflammatory that it inevitably threatens a breach of the peace, and thus could be analogized to &ldquo;fighting words&rdquo; and deprived of First Amendment protection entirely. In a separate dissent, Justice Stevens thought that the flag, even though it is in a sense an intangible asset, could be protected from desecration just as, say, the Lincoln Memorial could be protected from having a political message spray-painted upon it.

            seemed to be the statute&rsquo;s proscription of flag burning that would &ldquo;seriously offend&rdquo; observers &mdash; this reference to &ldquo;offensiveness&rdquo; made it clear that only flag burning intended to convey a particular message (disrespect) was proscribed by the statute. Therefore, immediately after the

            flag burning statute that would ban all or most flag burning without being content-based and thus unconstitutional. This federal statute, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, punished anyone who &ldquo;knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States. &hellip; &rdquo; However, even though the statute avoided any reference to conduct that would &ldquo;offend&rdquo; an observer, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, found that this statute, too, was a violation of the First Amendment.

                Johnson
            </span>
            , was content-based. &ldquo;Although the [Act] contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct, it is nevertheless clear that the government&rsquo;s asserted
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </span>
            is &lsquo;related to the suppression of free expression&rsquo; &hellip; and concerned with the content of such expression.&rdquo; The majority noted that the government was asserting its interest in preserving the flag as a

                symbol for certain national ideals
            </span>
            ; this goal was intimately related to the content of the burner&rsquo;s message (so that, for instance, a person&rsquo;s secret burning of the flag in his basement would not threaten this symbolic meaning of the flag). Since Congress was attempting to &ldquo;suppress &hellip; expression out of concern for its likely communicative impact,&rdquo; the statute had to be strictly scrutinized. It failed that scrutiny. (Interestingly, Justice Scalia was part of the five-member majority voting to strike down the statute, a surprise given his generally conservative views.)

            Centerville is a small town. Its two biggest streets are Broadway and Main. After several recent parades and demonstrations that badly snarled traffic, Centerville&rsquo;s City Council enacted an ordinance that forbade all parades from taking place on either Broadway or Main. The ordinance did not forbid parades on the other, smaller streets in town. There is no evidence that the ordinance was motivated by hostility to particular types of parades, and the ban has been enforced even-handedly as to all parades. Citizens Against Corruption, a group wishing to protest what it believed was corruption in the mayor&rsquo;s office, paraded in an organized way down Broadway, and its leaders were arrested. The city has asserted that its ban on parades is a valid &ldquo;time, place and manner&rdquo; regulation.

            An ordinance in the town of Harmony provides that &ldquo;no demonstration or parade involving more than 20 persons shall take place on the town&rsquo;s streets, parks or other city-owned property without the prior issuance of a permit.&rdquo; The permit is free, and is to be granted by the mayor&rsquo;s office, &ldquo;if the mayor concludes, acting in a reasonable manner, that the proposed activity would not be detrimental to the overall community, taking into account the &ldquo;time, place and manner&rdquo; of the activity.&rdquo; Firebrand, the head of a local group of anarchists, wished to conduct a demonstration in the park, at which he planned to urge his followers to immediately attempt a &ldquo;sit in&rdquo; of the mayor&rsquo;s office. The mayor, without knowing the precise purpose of the demonstration and knowing only that it was to be a demonstration against the local government, refused to issue the permit. In announcing the refusal, the mayor stated that &ldquo;there has been too much demonstration, and not enough cooperation, around here recently.&rdquo; Firebrand then brought suit for an injunction against continued application of the permit requirement, and for a declaratory judgment that the permit requirement as drafted was unconstitutional.

            Same facts as prior question. Now, however, assume that Firebrand ignored the ordinance, did not ask for a permit, and held a demonstration involving 30 people in a city park. He was arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. He now wishes to defend on the grounds that the ordinance is overbroad and thus facially invalid. Assuming that the ordinance is indeed overbroad, should the court acquit Firebrand? _________________

            The town of Lawton had a very carefully worded permit requirement. For any demonstration or parade involving more than 30 people, a permit was required, application for which must be made at least one hour prior to the close of business on the day before the proposed activity. Under the terms of the ordinance, the police commissioner was required to issue the permit, subject only to the rule that if in the commissioner&rsquo;s reasonable judgment, a breach of peace would be likely to occur which could not be controlled with the manpower available to the Lawton Police Department, the permit could be denied until such later date as proper police protection could be arranged (by borrowing from other police departments, if necessary).

            Rouser, a radical, applied late on Friday afternoon to make a speech on Saturday. Because past speeches by Rouser had led to skirmishes, and because the commissioner believed that under weekend police schedules only three officers would be available (a number which the Commissioner believed would not be sufficient if problems should occur), the Commissioner turned down the request for a permit, and suggested that Rouser wait until the following Saturday. A local Justice of the Peace Court was open Friday night, and the Justice would have had jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the permit requirement. However, Rouser did not seek an injunction. Instead, Rouser gave his speech anyway, and no violence occurred. Rouser was charged with violating the permit requirement. He is now defending on the grounds that he was wrongfully denied the permit, because there was not in fact a serious threat of a breach of the peace, and that even if there was one, the presence of three officers would have been sufficient.

            The city of Blue Bell has enacted an ordinance providing as follows: no &ldquo;canvasser or solicitor&rdquo; may ring the doorbell of a private home, or knock on the door of a private home, where her purpose is to distribute handbills or to solicit an order for goods, services or charitable contributions. The ban does not prevent a person from simply sticking advertising material under the door or into the mail slot, so long as there is no bell-ringing or door-knocking. The purpose of the ordinance is to avoid disturbing residents (including those who work nights and sleep days), and also to prevent crime (e.g., people who want to see into the residence to &ldquo;case the joint&rdquo; for a later burglary).

            The city of Crooklyn had two substantial ethnic populations that were frequently at odds with each other, Middle-eastern Moslems and Orthodox Jews. After complying with a city requirement calling for a permit before the making of a public address, Mohammed, a self-proclaimed Islamic Fundamentalist, gave a speech in a park in Crooklyn. There were approximately 100 Islamic followers in the audience, as well as a group of about 30 Orthodox Jews. The Jews carried signs opposing Mohammed. Mohammed then made various anti-Semetic inflammatory statements, such as &ldquo;Jews are corrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jews control the U.S. government.&rdquo; He also addressed the Jews in the audience, saying, &ldquo;You Jews in the audience today, you&rsquo;re not fit to kiss the dung-stained shoes of my poorest follower.&rdquo; At no time did Mohammed urge his audience to attack any of the Jewish onlookers or to otherwise commit immediate illegal acts.

            Some of the Jews in the audience began to shake their fists and yell back at Mohammed; five of them then began to move towards the podium with upraised fists. There were 15 police officers at the scene to prevent disturbances, most of them ringed around the podium. They immediately arrested Mohammed and charged him with violating an ordinance prohibiting anyone from inciting a riot or causing a breach of the peace. Mohammed has defended on the grounds that his arrest violated his freedom of expression.

            The Women&rsquo;s Health Alliance is a clinic that principally performs abortions. Abortion protesters decided to demonstrate outside the clinic. The protesters waved signs containing messages such as &ldquo;Abortion Equals Murder.&rdquo; Whenever the protesters saw a woman leaving the clinic, they shouted, &ldquo;Baby Killer,&rdquo; at her. The protesters remained at least 20 feet away from the front door of the clinic, and they did not block anyone&rsquo;s access to or from the clinic. All protesting took place on public property. A local ordinance forbids &ldquo;the making of any public statement or the showing of any sign where the speaker knows the statement or sign is likely to be offensive to the person to whom it is addressed.&rdquo; May a protester who has waved the sign and shouted the epithet described above be convicted of violating the statute? _________________

            The facts indicate to us that the ban is content-neutral both in terms of the purposes for which it was enacted and the way in which it is applied. However, it seems not to be &ldquo;

            governmental interest.&rdquo; Since the proposed speech would take place in the most traditional of all public forums &mdash; the streets &mdash; mere convenience, such as avoiding traffic obstructions, probably does not qualify as a &ldquo;significant governmental interest.&rdquo; Also, there are more narrowly-tailored restrictions that could be used, such as an advance permit requirement which would give the police time to detour traffic and thereby reduce disruption. Finally, the requirement that alternative channels be left open is strictly construed in a public-forum context; the fact that there may be other public places (e.g., smaller streets) where the same expression is allowed will not generally be enough to qualify as an adequate alternative channel.

            An advance permit requirement will be upheld if it is content-neutral, adequately constrains administrative discretion, and is a reasonable means of insuring that public order is maintained. However, in order to avoid giving the official charged with granting or denying permit applications too much
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                discretion
            </span>

            in the ordinance. Here, the standard given for granting or denying a permit &mdash; that the proposed activities &ldquo;not be detrimental to the overall community&rdquo; &mdash; gives the mayor virtually uncontrolled discretion, and acts as an invitation to him to behave in a content-based way. This excessive discretion makes the statute overbroad and vague. Therefore, even though Firebrand&rsquo;s own proposed conduct might be capable of being prohibited by an appropriately-drawn ordinance, the ordinance here must be struck down as invalid on its face.

There is an exception where the applicant shows that he could not have obtained prompt judicial review of the administrative denial of the permit; however, the facts here tell us that Rouser could have obtained judicial review prior to the time for the speech, if he had wanted to do so.

            narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leaves open alternative channels for communicating the information. Here, probably the requirement of content-neutrality is satisfied (unless there is evidence that, say, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses were a special target of the ordinance). The government probably has a significant government interest in preventing homeowners from being disturbed at home when they do not want to be. However, it is doubtful that the ordinance is &ldquo;narrowly tailored,&rdquo; since there are less restrictive alternatives (e.g., permitting a homeowner to indicate on his door that he does not wish to be disturbed by solicitors) &mdash; when the city makes a blanket assumption that
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                no
            </span>
            homeowner wishes to receive a solicitor, this is probably not a sufficiently narrowly tailored approach. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether alternative channels have been left open, since for many types of organizations, door-to-door and face-to-face is the only affordable means, given the large expense associated with, say, newspaper and TV advertising. Upon facts similar to these, the Court struck down a blanket ban. See

            . However, there are several exceptions and clarifications to the &ldquo;fighting words&rdquo; doctrine, which make it seldom applicable. One of those exceptions is that if the police have the physical ability to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                control the angry crowd
            </span>
            as a means of preventing threatened violence, they
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                must do so
            </span>
            in preference to arresting the speaker for using &ldquo;fighting words.&rdquo;

            . Here, it seems probable that the 15 police officers could have either arrested or at least restrained those Jews who were moving forward towards the podium, and probably any other hostile Jew in the audience. At the very least, the police needed to make some effort to do this, rather than immediately arrest the speaker.

            The problem is that the ban here is
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                content-based
            </span>
            . That is, it proscribes only certain types of speech, based on the content or message of that speech. Thus insults based on race, ethnicity and three other attributes are banned, but insults based on other attributes are not (e.g., the addressee&rsquo;s politics, intelligence, short or tall stature, etc.). Even if the university interprets the ban so as to bar only &ldquo;fighting words,&rdquo; this will not be enough to save the statute, because
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul
            </span>
            (striking down an anti-cross-burning statute) establishes that government may not ban some fighting words but not others, based on the words&rsquo; precise message. The best way for State U to solve the problem is to amend its code so as to ban &ldquo;all slurs, invectives, insults or epithets that would have the likely effect of either inducing the listener to respond with violence, or which would be likely to create in the listener an apprehension of imminent physical harm.&rdquo; Such a formulation would essentially ban all fighting words, plus all words that would constitute an assault; these two categories may clearly be constitutionally proscribed, as long as the proscription occurs in a content-neutral way.  (Of course, this re-write would fail to prohibit a lot of hate speech, so it would not be a perfect solution, but at least it would be content-neutral.)

Since the rights of adults are being curtailed in a content-based way, the statute will surely fail strict scrutiny.

            </strong>
            The libel law of Alabama, like that of most states at the time, provided for
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                strict liability
            </span>
            . That is, a publisher could not avoid liability by showing that he reasonably believed his statement to be true, if it was in fact false. Furthermore, although &ldquo;truth&rdquo; was an available defense under Alabama law, it was an
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                affirmative defense
            </span>
            as to which the defendant bore the burden of proof. Therefore, although the factual errors in the

            </strong>
            The Court found that the effect of Alabama&rsquo;s libel rules was similar to that of the original federal Sedition Act of 1798. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish any &ldquo;false scandalous and malicious writings&rdquo; against the federal government with intent to bring it into &ldquo;contempt or disrepute.&rdquo; Although the Act expired before the Supreme Court determined its constitutionality, the view that the Act violated the First Amendment had &ldquo;carried the day in the court of history,&rdquo; according to the

            </strong>
            The Court was not content merely to strike the libel judgment as a disguised ban on criticizing the government. Instead, it articulated a formal rule, so that future speakers would not have to worry about liability for libel in similar circumstances: the First Amendment prohibits a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                public official
            </span>

                relating to his official conduct
            </span>
            unless he proves that the statement was made with
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;actual malice&rdquo;
            </span>
            &mdash; that is,
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

The Court found that she was not a &ldquo;public figure,&rdquo; even though she had held some press conferences during the divorce trial, and even though the trial itself had been widely reported in the Miami newspapers. (Nor did Ms. Firestone&rsquo;s extensive activities before the trial as a prominent member of Palm Beach society make her a public figure.)

            The plaintiff, Gertz, was a locally well-known lawyer who represented the family of a youth who was killed by a policeman. Defendant, publisher of a John Birch Society magazine, falsely attacked Gertz as having helped &ldquo;frame&rdquo; the policeman and as being a communist.

                <span style="font-weight:normal;">
                </span>
            </strong>
            The majority reasoned that private individuals are both more vulnerable, as well as more deserving of recovery for defamation, than public figures. They are more
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                vulnerable
            </span>
            because public figures generally have &ldquo;significantly greater access&rdquo; to the media, and can use that access to counteract false statements. They are
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                deserving
            </span>
            of extensive protection against defamation, because public figures have generally &ldquo;voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehoods,&rdquo; unlike private persons.

                </span>
            </strong>
            The majority also held that, if a private figure shows only negligence on the part of the defendant, rather than recklessness or knowing falsity, he
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                may not recover presumed or punitive damages

            . (&ldquo;Presumed&rdquo; damages are ones awarded where there is no proof of actual harm, but the jury believes that damage would ordinarily result from a defamatory communication like the one in issue.) The Court imposed this limitation because the state&rsquo;s interest in giving broader protection to private figures only justified awarding &ldquo;compensation for
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                actual

            </strong>
            In holding that Gertz himself was a private figure, the Court implicitly took a narrow view of the term &ldquo;public figure.&rdquo; Gertz was a well-known lawyer locally, and had agreed to take a case which he knew would attract substantial publicity. Nonetheless, Gertz had not achieved &ldquo;general fame or notoriety in the community&rdquo; (so that he was not public figure for all purposes); similarly, he was not a public figure for the limited purposes of this case, because he had played only a &ldquo;minimal role&rdquo; in it.

            So some statements, even though they express opinions, may be the subject of defamation actions. But only when a statement contains or implies a statement of

                &ldquo;actual facts&rdquo;

A pure statement of opinion (e.g., &ldquo;In my opinion Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting the teachings of Marx and Lenin.&rdquo;) would not be actionable, because it: (1) is not provably false; and (2) cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about the plaintiff.

                i. &ldquo;No First Amendment value&rdquo; argument rejected:
            </strong>
            The government argued that false statements &ldquo;have

                no First Amendment value
            </span>

                rejected
            </span>
            this &ldquo;categorical&rdquo; assertion. True, certain categories of false statement could be restricted &mdash; categories like defamatory statements, perjury, and fraudulent statements intended to extract some material benefit from another (e.g., fraudulent commercial speech). But outside of these few pre-defined categories where there was inevitably some special harm caused by the falsehood, the Court had

                never held that false statements are without constitutional protection

                ii. Strict scrutiny applied:
            </strong>
            In fact, the plurality held, even though the Act barred only false statements, the Act needed to be subjected to &ldquo;the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

                most exacting scrutiny.&rdquo;
            </span>
            The plurality conceded that the government&rsquo;s interest in ensuring that the public&rsquo;s general perception of military awards not be diluted by false claims was a compelling interest. But no matter how compelling the government&rsquo;s interest, the statute could survive only if the particular restriction imposed was
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            The plurality concluded that the government had not made this showing of &ldquo;actual necessity.&rdquo; In particular, the government had not shown why

                &ldquo;counterspeech&rdquo;
            </span>
            would not suffice. For instance, in the case of false claims concerning the Congressional Medal of Honor (the most-heavily-punished type of violation under the Act, and the one with which Alvarez had been charged), the government could combat the lying problem by creating an
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                online database
            </span>

            Justice Breyer (joined by Kagan) agreed with the plurality that the Act was unconstitutional, making 6 votes for that proposition. But Breyer applied

                &ldquo;intermediate scrutiny&rdquo;

            rather than the plurality&rsquo;s strict scrutiny. Even under this easier-to-satisfy standard, however, the statute could not survive, because the government had not shown that a &ldquo;more finely tailored statute&rdquo; could not adequately address the harms. For instance, the statute might be rewritten to require that the false statement &ldquo;caused specific harm&rdquo; or was &ldquo;material.&rdquo;

            Three Justices dissented, contending that the statute was constitutional. Justice Alito (joined by Scalia and Thomas) pointed out that the statute was narrowly drafted, and reached only &ldquo;knowingly false statements about

                i. Harmful:

            On the other hand, Alito said, the lies forbidden by the statute &ldquo;inflict substantial harm,&rdquo; because they &ldquo;

            The dissent asserted that &ldquo;false statements of fact

                merit no First Amendment protection in their own right.&rdquo;
            </span>
            Alito conceded that in many areas (e.g., defamation suits brought by public figures), government needs to &ldquo;extend a measure of strategic protection&rdquo; even to false statements, in order to ensure sufficient

            Instead, the Supreme Court has attempted to lay down specific guidelines for what materials may, compatibly with the First Amendment, be punished as &ldquo;obscene.&rdquo; However, none of these attempts to define &ldquo;obscenity&rdquo; has turned out to be specific enough to give legislatures and lower courts reliable guidance about what materials are covered.

            If a work had some serious social value (e.g., of a literary nature), but its dominant theme was nonetheless one which &ldquo;excites lustful thoughts&rdquo; and is therefore &ldquo;prurient,&rdquo; it is simply not clear whether the material could be obscene under

            In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court relied both on the weakness of the state&rsquo;s interest in controlling private possession of obscenity, and on the strength of the individual&rsquo;s interest in not being forbidden such private usage. The state&rsquo;s interest was only the weak one of &ldquo;protect[ing] the individual&rsquo;s mind from the effects of obscenity.&rdquo; The individual&rsquo;s interest was directly contrary, and much stronger: that of

            than could be prohibited consistently with the First Amendment. For instance, the statute covered depictions in which a living animal was &ldquo;wounded or killed,&rdquo; even if no cruelty was involved. It was true that the statute applied only where the conduct depicted was against the law of the state where the video was made, possessed, or sold. But the statute by its terms would apply to, say, the depiction of hunting done by a particular method that was legal in the place where it happened, but illegal in the place where the resulting video was possessed or sold. Therefore,

But just as the Court in recent decades has held that the states do not have an unlimited right to ban or regulate speech merely by labeling it &ldquo;libelous&rdquo; or &ldquo;obscene,&rdquo; so the Court has now given substantial First Amendment protection to speech which can be described as &ldquo;commercial.&rdquo;

            In fact, in some senses this change towards more extensive First Amendment protection has been even greater in the commercial-speech area than in the areas of defamation and obscenity: in the latter two areas, the Court has simply limited governments&rsquo; ability to define these areas as broadly as they wish. Once speech falls within the allowable definition of &ldquo;libel&rdquo; or &ldquo;obscenity,&rdquo; it is completely without First Amendment protection. But most types of commercial speech, by contrast (all types except those that are misleading or that propose illegal transactions), are now

            This ban was held by the Court to violate the First Amendment. The Court conceded that this case involved speech that was

                purely

            The countervailing state interest in suppressing price advertising was that of maintaining &ldquo;a high degree of professionalism on the part of licensed pharmacists,&rdquo; an interest implicated by the possibility that advertising might lead to aggressive price competition, which might in turn lead to shoddy services.

The two cases were at absolute opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of the acceptability of the lawyer&rsquo;s conduct. Therefore, it is hard to know where the line will be drawn between solicitation that may constitutionally be prohibited and that which may not.

                advertising of liquor prices
            </span>

            Justice Stevens, speaking for a plurality in

                44 Liquormart

                A federal statute prohibits beer manufacturers from listing their beverage&rsquo;s alcohol content on the label. The federal government defends the ban on the grounds that it&rsquo;s needed to prevent brewers from engaging in &ldquo;strength wars,&rdquo; in which each maker increases its beer&rsquo;s alcohol content and then tries to lure drinkers by advertising the high content.

            , the statute violates the brewers&rsquo; free speech rights. The federal government does not prohibit alcohol strength listings in advertising, only on labels. Similarly, the government doesn&rsquo;t ban such listings for the labels of wines and spirits, only beer. These inconsistencies make the scheme so irrational that it does not &ldquo;directly and materially advance&rdquo; the objective of preventing strength wars.

                Massachusetts regulates indoor advertising for smokeless tobacco and cigars in a number of ways. One restriction is that advertising for such products cannot be placed lower than five feet above the floor of any retail establishment located within 1,000 feet of any school or playground.  The purpose of the regulation is to make tobacco products less appealing to minors, by limiting minors&rsquo; exposure to advertising about the products.

            Joe was the owner of &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s Jewelry,&rdquo; a jewelry store that was the only such store in the town of Liberty. Since Liberty was a small town, most people knew who Joe was, but they didn&rsquo;t know much about his personal life, and he had never been involved in politics. One day, the local newspaper, the

In fact, Tim was shot in Joe&rsquo;s store, but by Pete, Joe&rsquo;s employee, who Joe then immediately fired. (Tim was not in fact trying to shoplift, and Pete simply made a bad mistake.)

A state ordinance forbids the sale or possession of &ldquo;any pictorial material containing sexually explicit photographs that are obscene under prevailing constitutional standards.&rdquo; Assume that Emilio can be shown to have known the contents of both of these magazines.

            Congress has concluded that the nicotine used in cigarettes is &ldquo;highly addictive.&rdquo; Congress has also concluded that cigarette advertising causes many minors (who under federal and state laws can&rsquo;t legally buy the product) to take up smoking. Therefore, Congress has now banned all print advertising for cigarettes. Together with a prior ban on broadcast advertising for cigarettes, this means that billboards and handbills are now the only allowable means of advertising cigarettes. The cigarette industry asserts that this near total ban violates its right of free expression.

                Yes, probably.

            The first question is whether Joe is a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;public figure.&rdquo;
            </span>
            If he is a public figure, he may not be permitted to recover unless he shows &ldquo;actual malice&rdquo; on the part of the
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">

            had knowledge that its statement about who did the shooting was false, or that the

                Post
            </span>
            acted with &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo; of whether the statement was false or not. So if Joe is a public figure, then the judge&rsquo;s instruction is wrong. Joe might be held to be an &ldquo;involuntary public figure&rdquo; because of his involvement in this matter of obvious public interest; however, since he is not a criminal defendant, and since the Court has construed the &ldquo;involuntary public figure&rdquo; category narrowly, probably Joe does not fall into this category. Joe is certainly not a generally famous person (even locally), nor one who has voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy, so he probably doesn&rsquo;t fit into either of the other public figure categories recognized by the Court.

            On these facts, Kiddie World is probably not, strictly speaking, &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; under Supreme Court definitions. The reason is that mere nudity, without any attempt to portray sexual activity, is not considered &ldquo;obscene.&rdquo; However, the state&rsquo;s interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children is so strong that states may prohibit the sale, and even the private possession, of sexually explicit nude pictures of children, even though these are not strictly speaking &ldquo;obscene.&rdquo;

Furthermore, it&rsquo;s not clear whether the ban is &ldquo;not more extensive than is necessary&rdquo; to serve this interest, since there are some less-restrictive methods (e.g., a broader anti-smoking campaign, or higher taxes) that haven&rsquo;t been tried yet.

                Money in political campaigns, generally:
            </strong>
            In the modern political campaign, speech and the expenditure of money seem inevitably to go hand in hand. Whether money is spent by a private citizen who is contributing to a candidate, by a political action committee which runs advertisements backing or opposing certain candidates, or by a candidate himself, campaign spending has a strong expression component. Yet if corruption and the appearance of corruption are to be curbed, and if the cynical view that the richest candidate generally wins is to be proved wrong, some sorts of limits on campaign spending are probably necessary.

            Justice Burger dissented from the plurality&rsquo;s upholding of the contribution limits. In his view, contributions, no less than expenditures, were ways of communicating. Contributions were simply a way of &ldquo;pooling&rdquo; money, and were thus associational activities comparable to, say, volunteer work; therefore, freedom of

                association

In Burger&rsquo;s view, anti-bribery laws and disclosure requirements could solve the corruption problems inherent in large contributions just as they could in the expenditure context.

            Roberts conceded that the Court had long held that the

                base
            </span>
            limits &mdash; the maximum contribution by one donor to one candidate &mdash; serve the permissible objective of combating corruption and the appearance of it. (The plaintiffs in
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                McCutcheon
            </span>
            did not challenge the base limits.) The question was whether the
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                aggregate
            </span>
            limits, too, could be found to serve the anti-corruption objective. The federal government, defending the aggregate limits, argued that the answer was yes; for one thing, the government said, the aggregate limits would make it harder for donors and political parties to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                circumvent the base limits.

Thus, even apart from the unlimited &ldquo;independent expenditures&rdquo; that a wealthy donor might make to urge the election of particular candidates, the donor could give, for instance, an aggregate of nearly $2.8 million to all Republican House and Senate candidates ($5,200 x 535 candidates) in a single election cycle, as well as an even larger amount to a collection of political committees not under the control of any individual candidate.

If a corporation or union wanted to buy an ad expressly advocating the election or defeat of a particular candidate, that ad had to be paid for with hard (and thus tightly-regulated) dollars, and lots of information about the sponsor of the ad had to be disclosed. But if the sponsor avoided the &ldquo;magic words&rdquo; &mdash; i.e., words expressly advocating a particular candidate&rsquo;s election or defeat &mdash; then the ad could be funded by
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </span>

                &ldquo;issue ads&rdquo;
            </span>

                &ldquo;attack ads&rdquo;

            ).Thus a Republican-leaning advocacy group might purchase ads attacking Democratic Congressman Joe Smith&rsquo;s voting record on Social Security, and then conclude, &ldquo;Call Joe Smith and tell him to stop weakening Social Security.&rdquo; These attack ads were in fact often
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </span>
            So by enacting the BCRA, Congress tried to curb the abuses associated with both unregulated soft money and with issue ads purchased by that unregulated money. In doing so, Congress believed that it was acting to reduce not only corruption but the

            Citizens United, a non-profit organization that was the plaintiff, made a documentary presenting an unflattering portrait of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Citizens United wanted to pay for a cable TV video-on-demand presentation of the movie shortly before the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Regulations of the Federal Election Commission prohibited Citizens from paying for this broadcast with its unrestricted funds, on the theory that this would be a forbidden corporate-paid &ldquo;electioneering communication.&rdquo; Citizen United sued the FEC for a ruling that its free speech rights had been violated.

                unfair influence in the electoral process

                Campaign speech in judicial elections:
            </strong>
            In 39 states, at least some judges are
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>

            </span>
            rather than appointed. In these states, there is a risk that candidates for judgeships will, in order to get elected, say things or do things that may conflict with a judge&rsquo;s ethical obligations once elected.

        </p>
        <p class="_L6Text" id="102242" style="margin-top : 6.00pt;">
            For instance, the candidate may

            </span>
            on a controversial issue likely to come before her court, in which case the due process rights of the litigants might be impaired. Or, in order to defray the costs of running a campaign, the candidate may

                solicit funds
            </span>
            in a way that creates a risk that contributors (who may include potential litigants as well as lawyers) will
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                expect and perhaps receive favorable treatment

A 2002 case struck down a state law that barred judicial candidates from expressing their opinions about legal issues that may come before the court, but a 2015 case upheld a much narrower regulation that blocked judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign contributions.

            </span>
            taken together, constituted &ldquo;a state interest of the highest order,&rdquo; and thus a &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; interest. In fact, he said, the state&rsquo;s interest in maintaining public confidence in the integrity is even more important in the case of

            Roberts then turned to the issue of whether the ban here was sufficiently

                narrowly tailored
            </span>

                campaign committee

                &ldquo;raises a red flag&rdquo;

            But, Roberts said, &ldquo;the First Amendment

            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                imposes no freestanding &lsquo;underinclusiveness limitation&rsquo;

            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            A state &ldquo;need not

            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop,&rdquo;
            </span>
            and the ban here &ldquo;aims squarely at the conduct
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                most likely to undermine public confidence
            </span>
            in the integrity of the judiciary:
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                personal requests for money by judges and judicial candidates.&rdquo;
            </span>
            So the ban was indeed narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest in judicial integrity, thereby surviving strict scrutiny.

            We now examine several particular contexts in which special First Amendment problems have arisen.

            The conflict between First Amendment values and society&rsquo;s substantial interest in pursuing other important values can be seen clearly in the

                public school
            </span>
            context. On the one hand, the public school system is the community&rsquo;s principal means for transmitting knowledge and values from one generation to the next; this process unavoidably involves teaching students how, and sometimes what, to think. See 96

            Because of the procedural posture, the Supreme Court did not directly decide whether the school board had violated the Constitution in ordering the removal of the books. The plurality did, however, articulate what it saw as the appropriate constitutional standard: a school board has wide authority in determining what books to remove from a library, but it may not remove books for the purpose of
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                denying access to ideas for political or partisan reasons
            </span>
            . As an extreme example, the plurality noted that a Democratic school board could not, motivated by party affiliation, order the removal of all books written by Republicans.

He believed that the second article, which in the draft the principal saw identified a student who blamed her father for her parents&rsquo; divorce, unfairly denied the father the chance to respond.

                Morse
            </span>
            , students at a public high school were permitted to leave school to observe the carrying of the Olympic Torch; the excursion was treated as a school trip. One of the students, Frederick, while watching the Torch procession, unfurled a banner that said &ldquo;BONG HiTS 4 JESUS.&rdquo; (No one seems confident of what the banner was supposed to mean, though it seemed to express the owner&rsquo;s view that marijuana use was a good thing.) The principal demanded that Frederick take down the banner, because she thought it encouraged illegal drug use in violation of school policy; she also suspended him from school.

                ii. Action upheld:

            The Court held that the confiscation of the banner and suspension of Frederick
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                did not violate
            </span>
            his First Amendment rights.  The Court concluded that &ldquo;a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed

            </span>

                as promoting illegal drug use.&rdquo;
            </span>
            That was true even though the speech here could not reasonably be viewed as a threat to the school&rsquo;s discipline or mission. The Court reasoned that schools have &ldquo;an important, perhaps compelling&rdquo; interest in deterring drug use by schoolchildren.

B.L. tried out for the varsity cheerleading squad at the end of her freshman year, but was rejected and instead offered a spot on the junior varsity. When she got this news, she and a friend went to a local convenience store on a Saturday, from which B.L. used her smartphone to post two photos on Snapchat, a social media application. Snapchat allowed her to send these photos so that they could be viewed by her Snapchat &ldquo;friends&rdquo; (of which she had about 250), but would vanish after 24 hours.

            </span>
            First, in relation to off-campus speech, &ldquo;a school . . .
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

                responsibility

            </span>
            Second, &ldquo;from the student speaker&rsquo;s perspective, regulations of off-campus speech, when coupled with regulations of on-campus speech,
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </span>
            Consequently, &ldquo;courts must be
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                more skeptical
            </span>
            of a school&rsquo;s efforts to regulate off-campus speech, for doing so
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                may mean the student cannot engage in that kind of speech at all.&rdquo;
            </span>
            He continued, &ldquo;When it comes to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            Finally, Breyer said, &ldquo;the school itself has an interest in

            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

        <p class="_M4TextSub2dPar" id="142820">
            Breyer said that the Court would &ldquo;leave for future cases&rdquo; the job of deciding &ldquo;where, when, and how these features mean the speaker&rsquo;s off-campus location will make the critical difference[.]&rdquo; But the present case provided one example of how the features would be applied.

            First, the district claimed an interest &ldquo;in

                &ldquo;weakened considerably&rdquo;

                violated

            , states have a strong interest in preventing any conduct which interferes with the relationship between a client and his attorney. One concern which many states have had is that people or organizations might

                stir up litigation
            </span>
            in which they have no direct pecuniary interest, and might then exercise control over the handling of the law suit, control which should normally be solely in the hands of the lawyer and client. Most states would, for instance, prohibit the creation of a for-profit corporation whose purpose is to advertise to personal-injury victims the availability of contingent-fee representation, and to receive a commission, or &ldquo;forwarding fee&rdquo; from the lawyer to whom the corporation assigns a case; even under the modern Court&rsquo;s relaxed view of lawyer advertising, such prohibitions would almost certainly be upheld.

            , Virginia made it a crime for any organization to employ or compensate any attorney &ldquo;in connection with any judicial proceeding in which [the organization] has no pecuniary right or liability.&rdquo; The state also forbade any organization to &ldquo;control&rdquo; or &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; the lawyer-client relationship, or to &ldquo;intervene between client and lawyer.&rdquo; The Virginia NAACP brought about school desegregation cases by encouraging parents to become plaintiffs, by referring them to non-NAACP-staff lawyers, and by paying all litigation expenses. The Virginia courts held that these activities violated both the anti-control and anti-compensation rules.

            </strong>
            So far, nearly everything we have said in this chapter concerns the role of government as the regulator of speech by non-government actors. But sometimes,
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                government itself wishes to speak
            </span>
            .  And sometimes, government wishes to give
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                financial support
            </span>
            to certain speech by others.  In these two contexts &mdash; government as speaker, and government as funder of speech &mdash; government seems to have at least somewhat greater ability to prefer one viewpoint over another than it does when it merely regulates.  However, the law governing these two special contexts is far from settled.

                i. Facts:
            </strong>
            Prior to the litigation, Pleasant Grove, Utah, had permanently placed in a local park 11 displays and monuments donated by private groups. One of these was a Ten Commandments monument donated in 1971. Members of the Summum religion then asked the city to accept and display in the same park a monument showing the &ldquo;Seven Aphorisms,&rdquo; which Summum adherents believe were brought down from Mt. Sinai by Moses before he brought down the Ten Commandments. The proposed Summum monument was similar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments one.

                ii. The Ps&rsquo; argument:
            </strong>
            The Summum members argued that when Pleasant Grove accepted and displayed the Ten Commandments and other monuments, the effect was to turn the park into a public forum, thereby requiring the city to accept other kinds of monuments and displays on a content-neutral basis.

            But the Supreme Court held unanimously that the monument display was
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                government speech
            </span>
            , which therefore did not have to be content-neutral. Justice Alito&rsquo;s opinion said, &ldquo;Although a park is a traditional public forum for
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                speeches and other transitory expressive acts
            </span>

            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                permanent monument in a public park
            </span>
            is not a form of expression to which forum analysis applies. Instead, the placement of a permanent monument in a public park is best viewed as a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                form of government speech
            </span>
            and is therefore
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause

            .&rdquo; So the city was permitted to reject the monument from the Summum congregants.

                Specialty license plates:

                state-issued specialty license plates

            The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board gave organizations and individuals the chance to design a particular &ldquo;specialty&rdquo; license plate, by proposing a plate design containing a slogan, image or (most commonly) both. If the Board accepted a proposed design, vehicle owners could pay extra to use the specialty plate.

            SCV sued the Board, arguing that its rejection of the proposed plate

                constituted viewpoint based regulation
            </span>
            in violation of SCV&rsquo;s First Amendment rights. The Board defended on the theory that the plate and its contents constituted

                speech by the government,
            </span>

            Breyer&rsquo;s opinion pointed to several factors &mdash; taken from the analysis in
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                Summum

            </span>
            First, the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;history of license plates&rdquo;
            </span>
            shows that when the plates contain more than state names and vehicle identification numbers, the plates
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;long have communicated messages from the States.&rdquo;

                <img src="assets/SquareHollowBullets.png" style="width:0.8rem;height:0.8rem;">
            </span>
            Second, Texas license plates are &ldquo;often

            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            Finally, Texas
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;maintains direct control&rdquo;
            </span>
            over the messages on its specialty plates, and carefully
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                reserves the right to approve each specialty plate design
            </span>
            , thereby allowing the state &ldquo;to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                choose how to present itself

        <p class="_M4TextSubPar" id="100336" style="margin-top : 3.00pt;">
            Taken together, these factors convinced the majority that the specialty plates here &ldquo;are similar enough to the monuments in

                Summum

            As to conclusion (1), Alito proposed a thought experiment: &ldquo;Suppose you sat by the side of a Texas highway and studied the license plates on the vehicles passing by. You would see ... an impressive array of specialty plates [with] more than 350 varieties. ... You might see plates bearing the name of a high school, a fraternity or sorority, the Masons, the Knights of Columbus ... a favorite soft drink, a favorite burger restaurant, and a favorite NASCAR driver.&rdquo; He then asked, rhetorically, &ldquo;As you sat there watching these plates speed by,

                would you really think

            As to conclusion (2), Alito noted that the Board had rejected the plate design &ldquo;because it concluded that many Texans would find the flag simply

                &ldquo;pure viewpoint discrimination.&rdquo;

            And the Court&rsquo;s precedents, he said, made it clear that the government cannot practice viewpoint discrimination when it furnishes a limited public forum.

            The First Amendment does not explicitly mention the freedom of

                association

            However, the freedom of association has not been broadly construed by the Court. For instance, the Court has never held that any activity which an individual may lawfully do by himself, he is constitutionally entitled to do in concert with others. Rather, all that has been recognized is &ldquo;a right to join with others to pursue goals

            That is, a group of people do not have any specially-protected First Amendment right to gather together for social purposes such as dancing, partying, watching a sporting event, etc. These events are not primarily expressive events, so there is no special First Amendment right to

            Government is not absolutely forbidden to impair the freedom of association, just as it is not absolutely forbidden to interfere with freedom of speech.

            , states were free to require, or not require, non-union-member government employees to pay their share of the cost of the union&rsquo;s bargaining-related activities. Twenty-two states, including Illinois, enacted such statutes, making them &ldquo;agency shop&rdquo; states. The rest passed &ldquo;right to work&rdquo; statutes, which prohibited deduction of agency fees from non-members without their consent. That was the state of play when the Court decided

                ii. Janus&rsquo; attack on the statute:
            </strong>
            Janus, the plaintiff in the case, worked for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services as a child support specialist; he had declined to join the union that represented most Illinois public employees (the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, &ldquo;AFSCME&rdquo;). Under the Illinois agency-shop statute, the union was allowed to charge Janus an &ldquo;agency fee&rdquo; (by having the fee withheld from his wages) covering the union&rsquo;s direct costs of fulfilling its collective-bargaining obligation; the union set these at about 78% of full union dues. Janus asserted in the litigation that in view of Illinois&rsquo; &ldquo;fiscal crisis,&rdquo; he opposed certain positions the union had been taking in collective bargaining. Therefore, he said, the non-member agency fees charged to him were
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;coerced political speech&rdquo;
            </span>
            in violation of his First Amendment rights. This was exactly the argument that had been foreclosed by the decision in

            By a 5-4 vote, the Court

            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                agreed with plaintiff Janus&rsquo; argument.
            </span>
            Justice Alito, joined by the other conservative-leaning Justices (Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas and Gorsuch), said that even though the agency fees in theory related only to the union&rsquo;s collective-bargaining activities, the compulsory-fee arrangement
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;violates the free speech rights of nonmembers

            </span>

Taken in the context in which it was made, the remark was essentially a commentary on the President&rsquo;s policies and the attempted assassination, both of which were matters of public concern. Since the statement touched on a matter of public concern, the dismissal could only be upheld if the State bore the burden of justifying the discharge on legitimate grounds. Any justification had to take into account the context in which the statement was made, including &ldquo;time, place and manner.&rdquo; Here, P had no policy-making or law-enforcement responsibilities and her statement had no discernible impact on the functioning of the Constable&rsquo;s office, so the State failed to justify the dismissal.

            By a 5-4 vote, the Court agreed with the D.A.&rsquo;s position: &ldquo;[W]hen public employees make statements

            The four dissenters conceded that the majority was correct to recognize a government employer&rsquo;s important interest in ensuring that employees who speak for it while doing their work have competence, honesty and good judgment. But the dissenters, led by Justice Souter, would nonetheless apply a

For Souter, such a balancing was appropriate, for instance, &ldquo;when a public auditor speaks on his discovery of embezzlement of public funds, when a building inspector makes an obligatory report of an attempt to bribe him, or when a law enforcement officer expressly balks at his superior&rsquo;s order to violate constitutional rights he is sworn to protect.&rdquo;

                benefits
            </span>

                burdens
            </span>
            . That is, the government may not use as a basis for selecting which individuals are to be burdened the individuals&rsquo; exercise of constitutionally-protected rights (or any other constitutionally-illicit criterion, e.g., race). This is true even if the government would otherwise have the right to place that burden upon the individuals in question. For instance, &ldquo;there are First Amendment problems if only Democrats, or only critics of government, or only Socialists, are selected for

            case, California required any tax-exempt charity that solicited contributions in that state to file copies of the charity&rsquo;s &ldquo;Form 990&rdquo; with the state&rsquo;s Attorney General. The Form 990 is a form every charity is required to file annually with the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the form requires the charity to list the names and addresses of any donor who contributed more than $5,000 in the relevant year. California was thus requiring every charity soliciting contributions in the state to tell the state the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                names and addresses of every major donor.
            </span>
            The state promised to keep the information
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                confidential

            ; however, prior to the suit, the Attorney General office had inadvertently posted at least 2,000 Form 990s to the Department&rsquo;s website, thus making their contents public.

                a. The state&rsquo;s interest:
            </strong>
            In California, one of the jobs of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office is to
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                supervise charitable fundraising.

            Even had there been no automatic &ldquo;up-front&rdquo; disclosure scheme, the Attorney General would have been free to subpoena the Form 990 from any particular charity the A.G. wanted to investigate. But, the state said, collecting all Form 990s up-front
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                improved the efficiency

                b. Two plaintiffs bring suit:
            </strong>
            The disclosure requirement was attacked in separate suits brought by two charities (the &ldquo;Ps&rdquo;) associated with conservative causes. The Ps argued that by requiring them to file their Form 990s, the state was violating each charity&rsquo;s (and the charity&rsquo;s donors&rsquo;) First Amendment freedom of association. In part because of the inadvertent leaks of Form 990s mentioned above, the Ps argued, the disclosure scheme and related leakage risks made it
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                harder for them to fund-raise
            </span>

                &ldquo;invalid on its face.&rdquo;

            So far, we&rsquo;ve seen how his majority opinion decided that the disclosure scheme here violated the freedom-of-association rights of the two particular plaintiff charities who brought the suit (making this at least a successful &ldquo;as applied&rdquo; challenge).

            If so, the Court could find that the scheme was &ldquo;facially invalid,&rdquo; i.e., that it could not constitutionally be enforced against

                i. The test:
            </strong>
            Roberts noted that it&rsquo;s easier for the plaintiff to succeed with a &ldquo;facial challenge&rdquo; in First Amendment cases than in cases involving other parts of the Constitution. Outside of the First Amendment area, a plaintiff bringing a facial challenge has to show either that (a) &ldquo;no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid&rdquo;; or (b) the law lacks a &ldquo;plainly legitimate sweep.&rdquo;

            </strong>
            Sotomayor agreed with Roberts that publicizing individuals&rsquo; associations with a particular group might chill the group&rsquo;s and its members&rsquo; freedom of association by exposing them to harassment and reprisals. But in the Court&rsquo;s prior decisions, what had always mattered were the risks that
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;actually result[ed] from disclosure&rdquo;;
            </span>
            only after the plaintiffs showed an
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                actual burden
            </span>
            had the Court then required means-end tailoring, and the level of that tailoring was proportional to that particular burden. But now, she said, the Court had abandoned that established approach, by &ldquo;holding that narrow tailoring applies to disclosure requirements
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                across the board,

                i. No need for exacting scrutiny:
            </strong>
            Sotomayor sharply disagreed with this approach. The plaintiffs here had not produced
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                any
            </span>
            &ldquo;evidence of tangible burdens&rdquo; at all. Therefore, there was no need for the Court to perform any exacting scrutiny.

                b. Tailor the level of scrutiny to the degree of burden:
            </strong>
            Similarly, Sotomayor contended, in heightened-scrutiny cases the Court had always
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                adjusted
            </span>
            the required tightness of means-end fit in order to match the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                magnitude of the burden
            </span>
            the government was placing on the group&rsquo;s freedom of association. Now, the majority was unwisely shifting from this &ldquo;nuanced approach&rdquo; to a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo;
            </span>
            test &mdash; no matter whether the burdens the government was placing on associational rights were slight, heavy, or nonexistent, the Court was requiring that the disclosure regime
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                always be narrowly tailored.
            </span>
            This created a significant risk that disclosure requirements that should be constitutional would be struck down, Sotomayor said.

                c. Overbreadth:
            </strong>
            Finally, Sotomayor was especially critical of the majority&rsquo;s conclusion that the disclosure scheme was
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;facially invalid&rdquo;
            </span>
            &mdash; and thus could not be enforced against
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                any
            </span>
            charity &mdash; rather than merely invalid &ldquo;as applied&rdquo; to the two charities who had brought the suit. She conceded that facial attacks are (and should be) easier to win in the First Amendment area than in other contexts, because of the risk that imprecisely-drawn regulations will have a broad chilling effect on speech or association.

        </p>
        <p class="_L8Text" id="148240">
            But even in the First Amendment area, she said, the Court had never allowed a facial attack to succeed unless the regulation was shown to be unconstitutional in a

            was that each non-profit file with the state the non-profit&rsquo;s IRS Form 990, listing each significant donor&rsquo;s identity and the amount they contributed. The Court&rsquo;s logic almost certainly

            : the long-established requirement that non-profits file the Form 990 with the IRS seems now to be facially invalid (and thus unconstitutional) as to

                screening device.

            Thus the state can ask the initial question, &ldquo;Have you ever been a member of an organization which advocates forcible overthrow of the government, while knowing that that was the organization&rsquo;s aim?&rdquo; Then, if the answer is &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; the state can ask the follow-up question, &ldquo;Do you

            Thomas suggested, though he did not explicitly hold, that in view of his finding that professional speech should not be any easier for government to regulate in a content-based way than other speech, the appropriate standard of review should be strict scrutiny.

            </strong>
            Breyer noted that the majority opinion said it was willing to recognize an exception for laws that &ldquo;require professionals to disclose factual, noncontroversial information in their &lsquo;commercial speech,&rsquo;&rdquo; but only in the narrow situation where the disclosure
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

                numerous disclosure requirements
            </span>
            routinely imposed on the medical or legal professions &mdash; but not relating to the professionals&rsquo; own services &mdash; would now have to be subjected to heightened scrutiny. For instance, statutes requiring hospitals to tell parents about

            The Supreme Court would undoubtedly invoke the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions to strike down this statute as a violation of state employees&rsquo; freedom of expression.

                ): Congress has long provided federal grants to help private citizens operate family-planning clinics. Any program using these grants is known as a &ldquo;Title X project.&rdquo; The Secretary of Health and Human Services then makes a new interpretation of the grant program, under which every Title X project is prohibited from &ldquo;counselling [patients] concerning the use of abortion&rdquo; or from &ldquo;encourag[ing] or promot[ing] abortion.&rdquo; Grantees who have been receiving funds argue that this new condition violates their and their patients&rsquo; freedom of speech, by stripping the grantees of the right to counsel a patient that she has a constitutionally-protected right to have an abortion in certain circumstances.

The way the statute and interpretation are written, a Title X

                grantee

            , the no-editorializing rule is an unconstitutional condition. Congress had the power to limit how subsidy dollars are spent. But here, Congress went beyond that power, by preventing all editorializing by even stations that didn&rsquo;t use federal funding for this purpose. For the no-editorializing condition to have been constiututional, Congress would have had to give a station a way to use private funds for editorializing as long as the station made sure not to use the federal grants for these editorializing purposes.

It may sometimes be hard to tell on which side of the line a particular condition falls. But here, the Policy Requirement falls on the unconstitutional side of the line. &ldquo;By demanding that funding recipients adopt &mdash; as their own &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s view on an issue of public concern, the condition by its very nature affects &lsquo;protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.&rsquo;&rdquo;

            The First Amendment explicitly prohibits abridgment of the freedom &ldquo;of the press,&rdquo; in addition to protecting the freedom &ldquo;of speech.&rdquo; On its face, this language suggests that the organized press is entitled to somewhat greater First Amendment protection than are ordinary members of the public; otherwise, the explicit reference to the press would seem to be redundant.

            </strong>
            The Court did not find any evidence that the Minnesota legislature had tried to censor or chill the press. But the tax was a special one, not part of the state&rsquo;s generally-applicable use tax. Therefore, the Court concluded, the state had &ldquo;singled out the press for special treatment.&rdquo; Consequently, the tax had to be strictly scrutinized &mdash; it would be invalid unless &ldquo;necessary to achieve an overriding governmental interest.&rdquo;

                </span>
            </strong>
            There was evidence that the particular tax here was not especially burdensome to the press (since it was at the same percentage rate as the general state sales and use taxes, and applied only to paper and ink, not to the total price of the newspaper). Nonetheless, because the state had singled out the press, the &ldquo;
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                political constraints
            </span>
            that prevent a legislature from passing crippling taxes of general applicability are weakened, and the threat of burdensome taxes becomes acute.&rdquo; The
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                mere threat
            </span>

            </strong>
            The statute was not able to withstand the strict scrutiny to which the Court subjected it. The state&rsquo;s interest in raising revenue might be a compelling one (the Court did not say); but the singling out of the press for a special tax was

                not a necessary means

                burdens
            </span>
            the press, should be strictly scrutinized. Here, he calculated, the use tax was

                more favorable
            </span>
            to the press than, say, a sales tax set at the same percentage, but applicable to the newspaper&rsquo;s gross revenues. Therefore, there was a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; to the press, not a &ldquo;burden.&rdquo;

This aim remains a vital part of modern First Amendment doctrine, so that any governmental action which prevents expression from occurring (as distinguished from punishing it once it has occurred) is

                prior
            </span>
            to his expressive act, and yet goes ahead and does that act anyway, he will not be permitted to argue that either the underlying statute or the injunction was unconstitutional as applied to him (though he may argue that the statute was void on its face). See, e.g.,
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">

            </span>
            , 388 U.S. 307 (1967). Thus an unconstitutionally-imposed prior restraint is likely to cow the defendant into forgoing his First Amendment rights, at least during the length of time it takes to conduct an appeal. See Tribe, pp. 1042-45.

            There are two basic types of pre-publication restraints. One consists of governmental orders and court injunctions telling a particular person that he cannot engage in a certain type of communication. The other consists of a scheme requiring a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                license or permit
            </span>
            before a particular type of expression may be engaged in. Movie-censorship schemes are illustrations of the latter category. All of the cases involving the organized press, with which we are concerned here, are of the governmental-order or court-injunction type.

            In striking the injunction as an unconstitutional infringement of free speech, the Court held that the primary aim of the First Amendment was to prevent pre-publication restraints. The proper remedy for false accusations against public officials was by a post-publication libel action, not by a pre-publication procedure which the Court found to be tantamount to censorship.

            The four other Justices in the six-man majority believed that prior restraint of news publication could sometimes occur, but not in this case. This group, consisting of Brennan, Stewart, White and Marshall, argued that there must be a

                virtual certainty
            </span>

            To all of these four Justices except Brennan, an important weakness of the government&rsquo;s position was that

                no statute
            </span>
            provided for an injunction against news publication in circumstances like these. Separation of powers principles made it impermissible for the Court to issue an injunction where Congress had declined to act. (But Justices Stewart and White seemed to say that even in the

            As is well known, the newspapers&rsquo; source for the Pentagon Papers was Daniel Ellsberg, who was given them in confidence while he did work for the government. Had the government been able to show that the newspapers were

                receivers of stolen goods
            </span>
            , by showing that the newspapers were aware that Ellsberg&rsquo;s making and distributing copies was a violation of his obligation of confidentiality, it is possible that the Court might have found this to be grounds for an injunction. No subsequent case to reach the Court has faced this question squarely.

            </span>
            , 467 F. Supp. 990 (W.D. Wis. 1979), the district court enjoined a magazine from publishing an article containing
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                technical information about the H-bomb
            </span>
            . At least some of the materials had previously been declassified. But the U.S. convinced the court that these materials, taken together with other classified information (also sought to be released by the magazine), could pose a direct threat to national security by possibly &ldquo;allow[ing] a medium size nation to move faster in developing a hydrogen weapon.&rdquo;

            The judge reasoned that two main considerations made this case distinguishable from the

                Pentagon Papers

                </span>
            </strong>
            The court then balanced the dangers to the paper&rsquo;s First Amendment rights against the danger to the nation. As to the former, although the injunction might interfere with the magazine&rsquo;s broadly-defined First Amendment rights, it would not interfere with its &ldquo;laudable crusade to stimulate public knowledge of nuclear armament and bring about enlightened debate on national policy questions.&rdquo; The balance was struck in favor of the injunction; the &ldquo;disparity of risk&rdquo; between the danger to the nation and the damage to the paper&rsquo;s First Amendment rights justified what the court conceded was &ldquo;the first instance of prior restraint against a publication in this fashion in the history of this country.&rdquo;

Nonetheless, the United States has never gone even a single step towards the English rule, which makes illegal the pre-trial publication of information that might cause prejudice.

            The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice Burger, with whom four other Justices joined. Burger declined to hold that a ban on pretrial publicity could

Instead, he applied a test long ago advocated by Learned Hand for subversive-advocacy cases: the restraint should be allowed only if the &ldquo;gravity of the &lsquo;evil,&rsquo; discounted by its improbability&rdquo; is greater than the damage from impairment of First Amendment rights.

                speculative

                other alternatives
            </span>

                voir dire
            </span>
            , restricting statements by the lawyers, police and witnesses, etc.). Finally, the trial judge should have considered whether his gag order would even be effective, in view of the rumors which usually circulate in a sensational case. On balance, then, it was not sufficiently established that the benefits of the gag order outweighed its First Amendment dangers.

            </strong>
            Observe that the nature of the interference with First Amendment expression is quite different in this compulsory-disclosure setting than in the prior restraint area. In the latter setting, restraint is almost always sought
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                because of the communicative impact
            </span>
            which publication would have; thus prior restraints almost always call for &ldquo;track one&rdquo; analysis (to use Tribe&rsquo;s term), and strict scrutiny is obviously appropriate. But in the compulsory disclosure area, any interference with First Amendment expression (e.g., the drying up of information from informants, because they are afraid their confidentiality will not be preserved) is
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                incidental to,
            </span>
            not the purpose of, the disclosure. Therefore, these cases call for &ldquo;track two&rdquo; analysis, which as noted (

            ) is handled by a much less stringent balancing of harms and benefits. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court has been much less quick to accept the press&rsquo; arguments in the compulsory-disclosure area than in the context of prior restraints. See 94

                </span>
            </strong>
            The argument raised by Branzburg and two other journalists was that news-gathering often requires confidential sources, who agree to supply the journalist with otherwise unavailable information only if non-disclosure of the informant&rsquo;s name and/or some of the information is promised. If a grand jury could compel disclosure, the journalists argued, not only the source of the particular information sought, but other confidential sources in the future, would be dissuaded from talking to journalists.

            </strong>
            In rejecting the claim for a privilege, the Court held that such a privilege had never been found to exist, and that journalists had always been viewed as having the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                same duty as any other citizen
            </span>
            to disclose to grand juries information about crime. The majority was not convinced that a significant portion of information supplied by confidential sources would dry up, especially since such information was widely available to newsmen even though no privilege had ever been recognized.

            Even if significant impairment of confidential sources did occur, the majority saw no reason why &ldquo;[t]he public interest in possible future news about crime from undisclosed, unverified sources&rdquo; should take precedence over the governmental interest in prosecuting crimes about which journalists possess evidence.

            problem: recognition of a privilege would require the courts either to decide that only the &ldquo;organized press&rdquo; should be protected (and to define that term), or to make the privilege dangerously broad by protecting &ldquo;lectures, political pollsters, novelists, academic researchers, dramatists&rdquo; and anyone else claiming to be informing the public and to be relying on confidential sources.

            The crucial fifth vote was supplied by Justice Powell, who although he joined the Court&rsquo;s opinion submitted a separate concurrence as well; this concurrence made the result of the case somewhat ambiguous. Whereas the other four members of the majority rejected a qualified privilege, and left room only for a defense of harassment, Justice Powell&rsquo;s concurrence stated that claims of privilege should be decided on a

Powell suggested, for instance, that a newsman may obtain relief if he can show that he has been asked for information bearing &ldquo;only a remote and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation,&rdquo; or that his confidential sources would be compromised &ldquo;without a legitimate need of law enforcement.&rdquo;

            A vivid illustration of this principle occurred in a 2001 case in which a radio station played a tape of a cellphone conversation that had been intercepted in violation of a federal wiretapping law. Because the interception occurred without the participation of the station, and because the conversation involved important public events, the station could not be prosecuted for the broadcast.

            , the conversation was a cellphone conversation between two officials of a teachers union, who were discussing a bitter contract negotiation that they were having with the local school board.  During the conversation, one of the officials said that if the board remained intransigent, it might be necessary for the union to go to board members&rsquo; homes and &ldquo;blow off their front porches.&rdquo; An unknown person intercepted the conversation in violation of federal law and sent it anonymously to a radio station, which broadcast it. The two officials sued the station for damages, as allowed by federal and state wiretap statutes prohibiting the disclosure of intercepted telephone conversations.

            The Supreme Court has always recognized that the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
            </span>

                closer regulation
            </span>
            than newspapers and other non-broadcasters. The closer regulation of broadcasters derives from the fact that broadcast frequencies are a
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                naturally scarce
            </span>
            commodity &mdash; whereas there can in theory be an unlimited number of newspapers serving any particular market, the technology of broadcasting is such that there could only be a strictly limited number of television and radio stations serving any particular market. (This distinction is, in practical terms, much less convincing in today&rsquo;s world of UHF and cable television, massive FM as well as AM radio, Internet video, etc., than it was when broadcasting was largely limited to VHF television and AM radio. But the Court has not fundamentally altered its willingness to tolerate closer regulation of the broadcast media.)

            This regulation has generally been carried on through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Court has several times sustained the FCC&rsquo;s power to ensure various types of

                public access

            in which the Court upheld the FCC&rsquo;s &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; doctrine, by which broadcasters are compelled to grant individuals the right to reply on the air to political editorials or personal attacks. Similarly, the Court is probably more willing to tolerate closer regulation of

                context

But even here the standard of review reflects the Court&rsquo;s view that broadcasters should be subjected to tighter regulation because of their access to scarce airwaves: the mid-level review given to content-based broadcasting regulations is clearly less stringent than the &ldquo;strict&rdquo; (and almost always fatal) review given to content-based regulations against newspapers and other non-broadcasters.

            The State of Unionville enacted a statute providing that any union representing government employees in the state may withhold from the paycheck of each non-union-member an amount in lieu of dues (a &ldquo;mandatory agency fee&rdquo;) equal to the union&rsquo;s cost of representing that member in collective bargaining. The Unionville State Teachers Union therefore charges each teacher in the state&rsquo;s public schools who chooses not to join the union a mandatory agency fee equal to 75% of the amount each union member pays in dues. Pete, a teacher who has not joined the Union, sues it, claiming that the mandatory agency fee violates his freedom of expression, by forcing him to subsidize union speech that he disagrees with. (He claims that the Union&rsquo;s pursuit of higher teacher salaries is worsening Unionville&rsquo;s budget deficit.)

            Patti was the starting point guard for the girls&rsquo; varsity basketball team at Prep, a public high school in Prep township. Coach, the team&rsquo;s head coach, after repeatedly telling Patti that she had been shooting too much and passing too little, benched Patti for most of the next three games. On the Sunday following the last benching, Patti, from her home, posted a TikToc video showing her shooting a basketball, with a text superimposed over it reading, &ldquo;Fuck Girls Basketball. I&rsquo;m sooo tired of being benched for &lsquo;excess shooting,&rsquo; even though I&rsquo;m the best shooter on the team.&rdquo; The post was seen by two of Patti&rsquo;s teammates. Three hours after posting the video, Patti removed it, but by then one of the two teammates who saw it, Angela, had emailed a screenshot of it to Coach, together with a message from Angela saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really upset about this &ndash; Patti&rsquo;s complaining is bad for team morale.&rdquo; The next school day, Coach criticized Patti for the post, and Patti immediately apologized. Nonetheless, Coach suspended Patti from the team for the rest of the season, with the explanation that &ldquo;Your vulgar language, and your public criticism of my coaching decisions, are conduct detrimental to the team&rsquo;s welfare, for which a season-ending suspension is an appropriate punishment.&rdquo;

            Patti has now brought a federal-court civil suit against the Prep Board of Education (the &ldquo;Board of Ed&rdquo;), arguing that the suspension has infringed her freedom of expression. At a bench trial, the parties together have proved the above facts. The Board of Ed defends by arguing that the suspension was an appropriate punishment given that Patti&rsquo;s post violated both (1) the school&rsquo;s written policy against &ldquo;vulgar or lewd language in connection with a school-sponsored extra-curricular activity&rdquo;; and (2) a second written policy of the school, barring &ldquo;language or conduct that substantially disrupts an  extra-curricular activity.&rdquo; No evidence has been presented concerning any team member&rsquo;s knowledge of, or reaction to, Patti&rsquo;s post prior to the suspension, except for Angela&rsquo;s message to Coach. Nor has any evidence been presented about whether the Board of Ed has ever attempted to prevent or punish other episodes in which a student has made (in person or on social media) off-campus remarks containing vulgar or lewd language in connection with a school activity.

            There have been several bombings of government office buildings on the island of Puerto Rico recently. After each bombing, an anonymous caller has told the local newspaper that the bomb was planted by &ldquo;People for a Free Puerto Rico&rdquo; (PFPR), an organization dedicated to using any means necessary to end Puerto Rico&rsquo;s status as a United States territory and establishing it as a sovereign nation. There is evidence that the PFPR was able to plant the bombs so successfully inside the buildings because its members or sympathizers have jobs in government agencies located in those buildings, who could furnish information and access for placement of the bombs. To deal with the threat, the territorial government of Puerto Rico has now imposed a requirement that any new applicant for any government position must before being hired sign a loyalty oath stating, among other things, that &ldquo;I am not a member of the People for a Free Puerto Rico or of any group advocating the use of force to alter the territorial status of Puerto Rico.&rdquo; Ramona, an applicant for a position as a clerical worker in the Puerto Rican government, has declined to sign the oath, without specifying her reasons. Can the government constitutionally decline to hire her on the grounds that she has refused to sign?  _________________

Horace protested his innocence, and the District Attorney eventually decided that no charges should be brought. Shortly thereafter, Sheryl said to a co-worker, while on the job, &ldquo;I still think Horace took the money, and I think he&rsquo;s a crook.&rdquo; Another employee who overheard the remark reported it to Horace, who immediately fired Sheryl for insubordination and fomenting discord in the Department. Under the relevant Civil Service rules, Sheryl was an at-will employee who had no reason to expect continued employment.

            The state of West Carolina has assigned to the state&rsquo;s Attorney General&rsquo;s office the responsibility for ensuring that charities that solicit in the state do not commit fraud. Years ago, the A.G. promulgated a rule (&ldquo;Rule 100&rdquo;) requiring any charity that solicits more than $10,000 in total donations in any year from West Carolina residents to report to the A.G. the names and addresses of any donor (whether residing in West Carolina or not) who has contributed more than $5,000 in that year.  Rule 100 includes a promise by the A.G.&rsquo;s office that it will keep any reported information secret from the public. (However, several years ago, due to a clerical error in the office, the Rule 100 donor reports from several charities were made publicly available on the office&rsquo;s website.) The administrative history of Rule 100 shows that it was enacted so that if the A.G.&rsquo;s office ever had reason to suspect that a given charity was committing fraud in soliciting, that charity&rsquo;s up-to-date donor information would already be present in the A.G.&rsquo;s files, eliminating any need for the office to subpoena records from the charity at the start of an investigation.

            Toys for Kids, a Nevada-based charity that raises about $100,000 per year from West Carolina residents, has sued the A.G.&rsquo;s office in federal court, claiming that Rule 100 violates Toys&rsquo; (and its donors&rsquo;) First Amendment freedom of association. The charity argues that given the risk that the identities of its donors might be leaked by mistake (as happened previously), Rule 100 cannot survive the relevant standard of review &mdash; whatever that standard is &mdash; because any interest the A.G.&rsquo;s office may have in combating fraudulent solicitations can be adequately served by the less-intrusive alternative of issuing document subpoenas to a particular charity when and if the office has reason to suspect the charity of fraud.

            P.J. Summers, a former football player turned sports announcer, was charged with the brutal murder of his wife. While in police custody, Summers gave a confession. In pretrial hearings, the trial judge determined that the
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                Miranda
            </span>
            rules had not been complied with, and decided that the confession would not be admissible at the trial. The press learned of the confession through pretrial proceedings in open court, and did not act improperly in obtaining this information. Prosecutors decided to try Summers as a principal in the murder, and also decided to charge B.C. Scowling, a long-time friend of Summers, as an accomplice. Both trials were to be held simultaneously (but in front of separate juries) in proceedings conducted by Judge Jones.

        </p>
        <p class="_Q3" id="15658">
            Judge Jones was very worried that disclosures about the confession might make it difficult or impossible to impanel a jury that would be fair to Summers. Therefore, several days before jury selection was to start, Jones issued two orders from the bench: (1) he ordered that no newspaper, magazine or broadcaster report the existence or details of the inadmissible confession until after the jury had been picked (once the jury was picked, it could be sequestered, so that prejudicial disclosures would not matter anymore); (2) he also ordered that no lawyer on the case, including the lawyer for Scowling, disclose to the press or to anyone else the existence of Summers&rsquo; confession. (There was reason to believe that Scowlings&rsquo; lawyer planned to say in a public press conference, &ldquo;My client is innocent; P.J. confessed, and in his confession he said that he acted alone&rdquo;).

            Roger is a reporter for the Hillsdale Star, a local newspaper. In the most celebrated crime to hit Hillsdale in many years, Joshua, an eight-year-old boy, was found strangled in front of his house. The police have not found any suspects. One week after the killing, Roger published an article saying, &ldquo;A source that I cannot identify saw the crime from a distance, and believes that the perpetrator was a young white male about 22 years old, six feet tall, weighing about 175 pounds.&rdquo; In the ensuing months, the police have never been able to find this or any other witness to the crime. The prosecutor called Roger in front of a grand jury, and demanded that he identify the witness who served as his source. Roger stated under oath that the witness was fearful that the killer would kill her to silence her. Roger further stated that he had signed a written pledge to the witness that he would never reveal her name; only in response to this pledge did the witness agree to speak to him. Roger did say, however, that the witness lived in the neighborhood and that in his opinion, she could be identified by good police work. The judge then ordered Roger to disclose the witness&rsquo; identity, or be found in contempt of court. Roger refused. There is no state law relevant to the issue. Can Roger constitutionally be found in contempt and imprisoned until he divulges the name of the witness?  _________________

            on the related issue of &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; donation limits. Since the Court has not so far struck down the federal limits, the $5,000 limit presumably remains a valid means of achieving the compelling governmental interest in combating corruption and its appearance. (But the Court&rsquo;s tendency to strike an ever-broadening array of campaign-finance limits suggests that even this right to limit single donor-donee contributions may not remain in force indefinitely.)

On the other side of the equation, Sheryl was a low-level clerk, not a policy-making official; therefore, her speech was unlikely to have created a severe additional threat to the department&rsquo;s efficiency, especially since other people inside and outside the department were undoubtedly discussing the same much-publicized issue anyway.

                Rankin v. McPherson
            </span>
            . Consequently, a court would probably conclude that Sheryl&rsquo;s free speech interest outweighed the department&rsquo;s interest in maintaining smooth operations; if so, the court should order Sheryl reinstated.

        </p>
        <p class="_R3" id="37283">
            By the way, it makes a difference that here, Sheryl&rsquo;s statement was
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                not required as part of her job duties.
            </span>
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                Garcetti v. Ceballos
            </span>
            establishes that where an employee speaks as part of her official duties, what she says
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                gets no First Amendment protection at all.
            </span>
            So if, say, Sheryl&rsquo;s official duties had included the obligation to make a report about any conflicts-of-interest she observed on the job, her statement, &ldquo;Horace took money from Computer Systems in violation of our Department&rsquo;s conflict-of-interest rules,&rdquo; made in her officially-required report, would not get First Amendment protection, and Sheryl would now not be entitled to reinstatement. So it&rsquo;s only because Sheryl was speaking &ldquo;as a citizen&rdquo; (not as an employee) to her co-worker that she gets protection under

        <p class="_R3" id="37284">

                Connick

            , involved a California requirement that charities raising more than a certain total annual amount from California residents file with the state A.G.&rsquo;s office a copy of the charity&rsquo;s federal IRS filing (&ldquo;Form 990&rdquo;) listing the identity of significant donors. The California rule was obviously similar to Rule 100 here. The Court in
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
            </span>
            <span style="font-style:Italic;">
                Americans for Prosperity
            </span>
            concluded that (1) there was a significant risk that the public would learn the identity of donors appearing on the Form 990 (as the A.G.&rsquo;s office had inadvertently allowed to happen in the past); (2) members of the public might therefore harass the charity and its donors based on the leaked information; and (3) the disclosure requirement was not &ldquo;narrowly tailored&rdquo; to achieving the state&rsquo;s concededly-important goal of reducing fraudulent solicitations, because the A.G.&rsquo;s office  could have used the
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">

            </span>
            of waiting until it had reason to suspect a particular charity of fraud, and then subpoenaing the Form 990 from the charity. That same reasoning applies here, since West Carolina (like California in

            . A gag order is a species of prior restraint, so it can be allowed only if its benefits substantially outweigh its First Amendment dangers, something that will virtually never happen. Here, there are other methods available to the judge to help assure a fair trial (e.g., careful

                voir dire

                Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada
            </span>
            . The state must give guidelines that are reasonably specific about what kinds of disclosures are and are not allowed. The ban here, which refers specifically to the facts of the confession, seems to have adequate specificity. While some sorts of gag orders might unconstitutionally restrict a defense lawyer&rsquo;s right to defend his client in the public eye (e.g., the states probably can&rsquo;t prevent a lawyer from asserting that his client is innocent, or from generally describing the client&rsquo;s proposed defense), references to a co-defendant&rsquo;s inadmissible confession are probably the sort of unduly prejudicial remarks that a lawyer falling within the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction may be barred from making.

            Freedom of expression typically makes up a larger portion of a full-year Con. Law exam than does any other single topic. Almost any regulation of an individual&rsquo;s conduct may pose a free expression issue, so think very broadly. Here are some particular things to keep in mind:

            </span>
            Remember that free expression issues are posed not just where government is regulating &ldquo;speech&rdquo; but also where government is regulating
            <span style="font-weight:Bold;font-style:Italic;">
                &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;

                expressive component
            </span>
            . So for each activity that&rsquo;s being restricted, first deal with the issue: &ldquo;Is there an expressive component to the activity?&rdquo; If you answer &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve got a free expression issue. (

The statute is a violation of P&rsquo;s First Amendment freedom &mdash; even though the state has a more-than-significant interest in preventing convicted sex-offenders&rsquo; use of the Internet to locate new underaged victims, the statute restricts much more expression than would be reasonably necessary to achieve that objection.

            Congress prohibits the furnishing of &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; material on the Internet, hoping to keep this stuff away from minors. You should apply strict scrutiny, and strike down the restriction, because the total ban is overbroad &mdash; the ban covers material that could be proscribed because it&rsquo;s obscene, but also material that&rsquo;s not obscene and thus protected as to adults.

            You should say the P&rsquo;s free expression has been violated: since the speech took place off-campus (and not directly as a part of a school-sponsored activity), the school&rsquo;s interest in regulating that speech was relatively weak, especially since the team members&rsquo; lack of reaction suggests that the tweet was not very disruptive. P&rsquo;s interest in commenting about a matter of public concern (his allegation that the coaches are unfairly responding to parental lobbying) outweighs the school&rsquo;s weak interest in regulation.

            Only two of the four Justices who agreed with the result reached by Roberts &mdash; that the Canon was constitutional &mdash; agreed with him that strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard. The other two (Ginsburg and Breyer, both concurring only in the result) would have applied a less rigorous standard (though they didn&rsquo;t say what it was), making five Justices to hold the ban constitutional. But the four dissenters (Scalia, Kennedy, Alito and Thomas) all believed that strict scrutiny was required, and that the ban could

So one majority of the Court &mdash; Roberts plus the four dissenters &mdash; believed that strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard, but a different majority (Roberts, plus two others who joined his reasoning, and another two who concurred only in result) believed that the ban could survive whatever scrutiny that particular Justice thought was the right standard.

            Notice that I&rsquo;ve designed this hypothetical statute so that it applies even where the state has no legitimate interest in curbing the criticism. If such a law instead only applied, say, to high-ranking policy-making employees to prevent them from publicly criticizing their own superiors while performing the functions of the job, the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine wouldn&rsquo;t apply. In this situation, the Court would almost certainly hold that the government has an overriding interest in assuring that high-level employees don&rsquo;t impair their own performance or that of their superiors by on-the-job criticisms of superiors.
